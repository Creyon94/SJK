# Rendering and UI

The wgpu renderer lives in `jkr-viewer`. JKA content enters through owned BSP,
model and shader data; GPU resources stay in the viewer. The renderer consumes
BSP geometry, PVS visibility, lightmaps, shader stages and legacy models.

## Where to work

| Area | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| GPU/device setup | [gpu_context.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/gpu_context.rs) |
| World loading | [world_load.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_load.rs) |
| World materials | [world_materials.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_materials.rs) |
| Optional material maps | [material_maps.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/material_maps.rs) |
| Main scene passes | [main_scene_pass.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/main_scene_pass.rs) |
| Secondary views | [scene_views.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/scene_views.rs) |
| Sun and real-time lighting | [sun_shadows.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadows.rs) |
| Post processing | [post_aa.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_aa.rs) |
| Frame timing | [frame_pacing.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_pacing.rs) |
| HUD integration | [hud.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/hud.rs) |
| Material map generator (tool) | [jkr-materialgen](../crates/jkr-materialgen/src/lib.rs) |

The normal BSP path supports additional lighting, shadows, GI probes, ambient
occlusion, reflections and post processing. Feature presence does not establish
correctness on every map or GPU. Preserve the ordinary BSP/material path when
working on optional effects and validate shared WGSL programs on an actual GPU.

wgpu picks the graphics backend; JKR requests none. On Windows Vulkan is enumerated
first, and `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12` selects DX12, which compiles shaders with FXC
unless `dxcompiler.dll` is on the `PATH`. FXC can only assign a runtime-indexed
vector or matrix component (`v[i] = ...`) by unrolling the loops around it, and
fails (error X3511) when any of those loops has a runtime trip count. Write such
updates as whole-vector operations, as the skinning loop in
[gpu_skinning.wgsl](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/gpu_skinning.wgsl) does;
[world_shader_fxc_tests.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_shader_fxc_tests.rs)
checks the world programs for this pattern.

Material compilation merges a shader's first two stages into one multitextured
pass under rd-vanilla's `CollapseMultitexture` rules, and never a later pair. The
colour generators are compared after `ParseStage` defaults: an unset rgbGen is
identity, or identityLighting when the blend source is `GL_ONE` or `GL_SRC_ALPHA`
([stage_colour.rs](../crates/jkr-shader/src/stage_colour.rs),
[world_stage_collapse.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_stage_collapse.rs)).

Programs are embedded with `include_str!`, so they carry the checkout's line
endings. Code that patches a program by text with a pattern spanning a line break
normalises it first with [wgsl_source.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/wgsl_source.rs);
`.gitattributes` keeps `*.wgsl` LF in new checkouts.

## Load-time texture and light preparation

World installation prepares unique mipmapped texture arrays on up to four CPU
workers before assembling material stages. Prepared batches are limited to
64 MiB of mip pixels; a single larger animated array is processed alone. GPU
uploads and material-cache mutation remain on the installer. Non-mipmapped
filter modes retain their existing upload path. Layer resizing and mip filtering
are unchanged.

The process-local CPU mip cache retains at most 128 MiB of source and mip pixel
storage and 1,024 entries. Keys include target dimensions and retained decoded
image identities, whose upstream cache checks mounted content, so replacing a
texture cannot select a stale chain by filename. Active uploads may temporarily
retain evicted data. These budgets do not describe total process memory. Cache
locking and allocation happen during loading, not during drawing.

Lamp extraction uses up to four workers for ordinary maps as well as large ones,
preserving emitter output order. Each emitter reuses sorted neighboring patch
IDs while its spatial cell and patch count remain unchanged; live patch moments
and the lowest-eligible-patch selection are preserved. Emission masks use an
exact single-cell reduction for aligned power-of-two blocks and the previous
area-overlap calculation for other dimensions. These changes reduce preparation
work without reducing source count, texture resolution or lighting quality.

## Selected controls

| Cvar | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `jkr_dayNight` | Map-relative sun/sky atmosphere; default 1, restart required |
| `jkr_realtime` | Lighting tier; default 0. Tier 1 retains world shadow casters between frames; tier 0 also uses available baked indirect light. Applies at map load |
| `jkr_dayHour` | Solar hour, updated live when day/night resources are installed |
| `jkr_dayMinutes` | Minutes per simulated day; 0 holds the hour |
| `jkr_indirectBoost` | Live sky/bounce illumination multiplier, 0–4; default 1. Does not amplify direct lights or add bounce iterations |
| `jkr_ambientFill` | Live material-lighting floor in dark areas, 0–0.2; default 0.025. Fades as existing illumination increases |
| `jkr_ambientFillOcclusion` | Fraction of ambient occlusion applied to the readability fill, 0–1; default 1 preserves the previous response. Real indirect lighting keeps full occlusion |

See [day_night.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/day_night.rs),
[sun_shadow_settings.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadow_settings.rs) and
[post_hdr.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_hdr.rs). A lighting tier alone does not
enable the day/night system. HDR here describes the scene buffer and display
mapping, not a claim of HDR monitor output.

Dust motes ([dust_motes.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/dust_motes.rs)) appear only
in the current main-view godray volume. Each mote samples local sunlit scattering
and subtracts the same wide slice mean used by volumetric clarity. This is a
sample at the mote's depth, not accumulated brightness along the whole screen
ray: a beam farther away cannot light dust in dark air in front of it. Shadowed
cells and uniformly lit air at clarity 1 produce no dust. Beam radiance supplies
both colour and a smooth visibility weight, so the camera's light-grid sample
no longer controls dust brightness. No active volume, no sunlight, or a hidden
volumetric pass means no dust. Secondary views remain excluded.

The shader still generates up to 2048 world-space motes in a wrapping 640-unit
cube, with distance and near-eye fades, depth testing and peak opacity 0.35.
`jkr_dust` controls density and opacity; it does not enable volumetrics implicitly.
The Game tab calls it **Sunbeam dust**. Shared froxel parameters and depth mapping
keep the sampling coordinates aligned with godrays. The pass reuses existing
volume textures and slice means after their current-frame computation, with no
extra volume, readback or per-frame CPU light-grid sample. Uniform writes use
`FrameQueue`. Dust work is included in the `volumetrics` GPU phase, so compare
that phase with dust off/on at the same view and settings.

Per-map tuning remains unimplemented. Motes behind glass do not inherit its
tint, and their beam boundaries have the resolution of the selected volumetric
grid. Owner visual acceptance and populated-match readability remain open.

Beam-dust verification on 2026-10-02 used Linux / Rust 1.96.1, Ryzen 5 5500
and Radeon RX 9060 XT (RADV). Formatting, locked workspace build/tests and the
release viewer build passed. An external GPU probe executing the production
sampling function checked dark cells, uniform haze, a coloured beam isolated to
a distant depth, out-of-volume coordinates and points behind the eye. Dark/haze
and excluded samples returned zero; the distant beam did not light the nearer
sample. The godray shader's existing calculations are unchanged; only its
parameter ABI and depth mapping moved to a shared include.

External native 1280×720 captures covered dust off/on on `ffa3` and `ffa1`,
volumetrics disabled, and SDR output. With volumetrics disabled, off/on captures
differed by at most 3/255 per channel; the missing volume bypasses the dust draw.
The sampled combined volumetric/dust GPU phase was 0.133 → 0.138 ms on `ffa3`
and 0.136 → 0.140 ms on `ffa1`. These short fixed-view runs used a frozen shader
clock for capture, omit populated-match workload, and establish integration and
indicative GPU cost only. No verification hooks or fixtures are shipped.

## Volumetric silhouette coverage

The volumetric injection pass averages lighting over visible air samples within
each cell. Samples behind the scene surface are excluded from both the sum and
the count; visible samples in shadow still count as zero illumination. Counting
hidden samples as darkness reduced the background's light beside a foreground
player or geometry edge. The final composite still integrates only to the
pixel's surface depth, and wholly hidden cells remain empty. Grid sizes, sample
counts, shadow filtering and clarity settings are unchanged.

External Linux/RADV release captures on RX 9060 XT, based on `a993436` plus local
changes, reproduced the fringe on `mp/ffa5`. Player-present/absent and volume-on/off
comparisons isolated a 6-level RGB loss just outside the helmet; the correction
reduced it to zero. A nearby outside strip's mean negative difference fell from
4.415 to 0.001 levels. The camera matches the owner's mark, but the preview actor
placement is approximate because marks do not retain actor state.

At 1280×720, 600-frame throughput measurements were 1.116 ms before and 1.112 ms
after; at 3840×2160 they were 3.375 and 3.380 ms. Increasing the old grid to quality
3 instead measured 1.471 ms at 720p and retained a narrower fringe. These are
single-actor scene measurements with another client open, not GPU-isolated or
populated-match performance certification. Paired captures also cover `mp/ffa3`,
the marked `T2_Rancor` interior and 24 camera turns on FFA5 at 4K. The correction
does not remove all finite-grid undersampling; broader maps, motion and owner
playtesting remain required.

## Inferring fixture light from legacy materials

Prefer compiler-authored `q3map_surfacelight` power and `q3map_lightimage` masks.
Where that information is absent, fixed, non-sky, undeformed materials can supply
emission through view-independent additive stages. The source classifier uses the
shader's blend, colour generation, glow flag and actual texture mask; a texture
name containing "light" is not sufficient. Environment reflections, entity-coloured
stages, unresolved images and ordinary opaque paint do not become inferred lamps.

Explicit `glow` stages on these undeclared fixtures now use a white-radiance
fallback of 16, compared with 4 for unmarked additive decoration. This distinguishes
an authored luminous fixture from a generic additive effect. It is an artistic
fallback, not a recovered physical intensity: the flag carries no wattage. Declared
surface lights and effect-sprite extraction retain their previous gains. Both mean
energy and the spatial emission mask use the same gain; black housing and gaps stay
dark, and alpha covers still attenuate the source. Inference happens during loading,
without a new per-frame classification pass or texture-name exceptions.

The owner-marked `mp/ffa_mtd` view exposed insufficient inferred power rather than
unrecognized ceiling fixtures. Its `textures/massassi/light7` shader has an explicit
additive glow but no compiler surface-light power. The 12×12-unit faces generated
about 298 units of patch power with a 277-unit influence radius: their contribution
was already fading strongly around floor distance. The new inference gives the
sampled patch about 1,191 power and a 550-unit radius. Disabling candidate importance
filtering or static shadows in an external diagnostic barely changed that view;
neither diagnostic change is included in production.

Verification (2026-10-03, local change based on `8f692ac`): workspace build,
all nine existing Cargo tests and doc tests, formatting, and the optimized owner
build passed. Eight external source-policy cases checked explicit glow versus
unmarked/declared fallback, shared mask energy, dark texels and entity/environment/
opaque/missing-image exclusions. Linux/RADV release captures at 1280×720 covered
the marked custom-map view and stock `ffa3`/`ffa1`; the custom view retained its
dark atmosphere with more local illumination. In that map the inferred source
count grew from 27,465 to 27,576, grid references from 5.79 to 5.96 million, and
the static visibility atlas from 121.5 to 122.2 MiB. Settled sampled GPU totals
were approximately 0.582→0.568 ms there, 0.506→0.505 ms on `ffa3`, and
0.742→0.715 ms on `ffa1`. These sparse samples with a separate owner client still
running show no observed regression in those views; they do not establish a
speedup or certify populated-match performance. Windows runtime and wider
custom-map coverage remain unverified. No test harness or assets were added to Git.

The fallback cannot recover compiler-stripped point lights or confidently identify
a lamp drawn only into ordinary diffuse paint. Improving those cases needs additional
authored evidence or a separately validated inference method. No claims of complete
custom-map light recovery are made.

### Static model fixtures

`misc_model_static` lamps now enter the same source collection as BSP fixtures.
Previously their model materials could display glowing bulbs while none of their
placed triangles supplied room lighting. Resolve each model once at map load,
reuse the existing static-placement parser, and integrate the luminous surfaces
with their placed position, rotation, inverse-transpose normal and scale. Each
placement keeps its own emitting area. Moving/network entities, pickups and
actors do not become permanent sources. The resulting lights use the existing
lamp grid, static visibility, receiver cache and probe-bounce path; there is no
new per-frame discovery or model loading.

Unlit opaque replacements can hide earlier shader stages. Source inference now
examines the surviving stage suffix, so an opaque luminous face following an
additive stage is eligible. Bright texels qualify an otherwise unlit fixture even
when dark housing lowers the whole-image average; power still uses the complete
area-weighted mask. Ordinary diffuse/vertex/entity-lit paint remains excluded.
A model surface's luminous pieces share a range calculated from their combined
power, so texture subdivision does not give every small piece a prematurely
short reach. Their summed energy is unchanged. This shared range is per placed
model surface; it does not combine all instances across the map or change BSP
surface-light range policy.

Verification (2026-10-03, local change based on `8f692ac`, on top of the inferred
glow/readability preview): release Linux/RADV captures at 1280×720 covered both
owner marks on `t2_rancor` and stock `mp/ffa1`/`mp/ffa3`. Static models were also
rendered in the external captures. Rancor gained 3,485 model patches (4,340 total
lights became 7,825); grid references rose from 755,662 to 1,289,445. Both marked
rooms gained localized illumination and remained dark. The sampled `ffa1` image
changed by at most 1/255, and `ffa3` by at most 2/255. External policy checks
covered hidden shader stages, unlit versus diffuse paint, bright inserts in dark
masks, unchanged integrated flux and combined fixture reach. Workspace build,
Cargo tests, formatting and the optimized owner build passed. A paired Rancor
capture with day/night disabled was byte-identical before and after.

Settled GPU medians, from 11–12 samples per view, were 0.893→1.036 ms and
0.822→0.839 ms at the Rancor marks, 0.722→0.721 ms at `ffa1`, and
0.521→0.527 ms at `ffa3`. The additional Rancor sources have a measurable cost.
A separate owner game was running; these are fixed-view GPU samples, not
exclusive-device total-frame or populated-match certification. Windows runtime
and other model-heavy maps remain unverified.

This repairs missing source participation, not all dark-room readability.
`t2_rancor` also requested baked ambient light (`ambient 20`); that background
illumination is not reconstructed by this change. Its inferred fixtures still
lack authored physical power, unlike several strong surface lights in `ffa1`.
Prop housing has not been added to the immutable world occluder geometry, and
moving/triggered model lamps remain outside this static-source path. No global
exposure, sun, ambient-fill or authored-light-power change is part of this step.

### GI traversal correction

The voxel GI tracer now measures a positive forward distance to the next cell
boundary for either ray direction. Previously negative-direction rays used a
signed coordinate difference divided by an absolute direction, producing hits
behind the ray origin and incorrect surface/depth samples. Traversal also checks
the maximum range before accepting an occupied cell, preventing hits beyond the
requested distance. This changes the probe tracer, not the separate triangle
visibility tracer used for direct lamp shadows.

Verification (2026-10-03, local change based on `8f692ac`, including the preceding
fixture preview): an external GPU harness compared the actual WGSL against an
independent double-precision ray/AABB reference. All 8,302 cases pass, covering
both axis directions, all diagonal octants, random oblique hits/misses, and ranges
below/at/above intersections. The preceding shader failed 3,174 of these cases.
Workspace build, all nine existing Cargo tests and doc tests, formatting, and an
optimized owner build passed. No diagnostic or test code was added to production.

Fixed-camera release GPU comparisons used the same 1280×720 settings, hour,
exposure, lamp data and indirect gain before and after. Both marked `t2_rancor`
images were byte-identical. The `ffa1` comparison changed by at most 1/255;
`ffa3` had a small local difference (mean absolute channel difference 0.0105/255,
maximum 10/255). Thus this is a verified correctness fix, not evidence that
Rancor's low visibility is solved. GPU readback confirms its live probes do update
and contain nonzero lighting; room-wide receiver coverage and effective bounce
strength still need investigation before deciding on another brightness change.
Rancor's 208-unit probe spacing aligns with its 16-unit voxel grid, so the old
sign error vanishes at those ray origins. The corrected range check still changes
some distant probe values. At the earlier `mp/ffa_mtd` mark (624-unit probe spacing,
64-unit voxels), the correction does change local illumination: mean absolute RGB
difference 0.0358/255, maximum 38/255. It does not broadly brighten that room.
Paired readback on Rancor changed the L0 coefficient of 11,026 of 29,541 live
probes above a 1e-7 threshold, while the closest probes to both marks remained
essentially unchanged.

Settled GPU medians (11–13 samples per view) were 1.038→1.038 ms and
0.825→0.825 ms at the Rancor marks, 0.742→0.733 ms at `ffa1`, and
0.512→0.533 ms at `ffa3`, and 0.639→0.649 ms at `mp/ffa_mtd`. A separate owner client was running. These sparse
fixed-view GPU results do not establish a speedup, exclusive-device performance,
31-player frame times or Windows behavior. The owner approved publication of the combined lighting/transition preview;
this does not close the remaining dark-interior investigation.

## Indirect lighting and dark-area readability

These controls affect the day/night real-time material-lighting path, including
world surfaces, actors and reflection receivers. They do not change the ordinary
baked-lighting path, direct sunlight, lamp intensity, emissive materials or exposure.
The indirect multiplier includes the probe sky contribution and the sky fallback;
it is not a multiplier exclusively on secondary bounces. It is applied at the
receiver after probe sampling, so boosted energy never feeds back into the probe
solver. World-space probe visibility and wall rejection remain unchanged.

Defaults retain the previous lighting response. Start a comparison with
`jkr_indirectBoost 2`, leaving `jkr_ambientFill 0.025` and
`jkr_ambientFillOcclusion 1`. For a separate, stronger readability comparison, try
fill `0.05` and fill occlusion `0.5`. These are experimental settings, not new
recommended defaults. Restore all three values to `1`, `0.025`, `1` respectively
for the original response. Controls are live and archived.

Fill occlusion only changes the small artificial fill: at `0.5`, fully occluded
fill retains half its unoccluded contribution. Physical sky/bounce stays fully
occluded. Fill remains material-modulated, so black materials stay black. A room
with almost no indirect energy may change little under the multiplier alone;
blindly increasing it can brighten outdoor shade before fixing that room.
Automatic exposure, local exposure and player-specific contrast effects are not
part of this experiment.

Verification of the local change based on `8f692ac` (2026-10-03): Linux/Vulkan,
Radeon RX 9060 XT, external release captures at 1280×720, fixed 11:00 sun.
The outdoor `mp/ffa3` and indoor `mp/ffa1` views exercised live changes and floor
reflections; a Kyle preview also rendered under the live controls in `ffa1`.
Returning both controls to 1 reproduced each starting image exactly.
Against separately compiled preceding shaders, baseline captures differed by at
most 19/255 on `ffa3` (mean absolute channel error 0.00057/255) and 1/255 on `ffa1`
(mean 0.0000125/255); cross-build images are not claimed bit-identical.
An external 1,024-case GPU check passed baseline agreement, isolated indirect gain,
bounded fill and zero-energy behavior with fill disabled. HDR/tier 0,
SDR/tier 2 and day/night-disabled paths rendered successfully; the latter stayed
byte-identical across the live control changes. Workspace build,
tests and formatting, and the optimized owner client build passed.

Sampled steady-state light-pass medians for old/new default shaders were
0.212/0.214 ms on `ffa3` and 0.157/0.158 ms on `ffa1`; enabling the controls showed
no consistent additional cost at this resolution. A separate owner game remained
running, so these are non-exclusive GPU checks, not a performance certification.
Populated combat visibility, broader map coverage and 31-player performance remain
owner-playtest/benchmark work. No new shadow lights, passes or probe rays were added.

Sun-shadow filtering compensates for the receiver surface's slope across the
full texel footprint of a linear depth comparison. A half-texel allowance only
covers samples midway between texel centers and can produce bands of false
self-shadowing on flat surfaces. Keep this allowance tied to the cascade's
texel size and receiver slope; increasing a fixed world-space offset can detach
shadows from walls and ground contacts.

The full-footprint correction was checked against the preceding shader from
`4a8fe31` with external release captures on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT), at
1920×1080 with HDR, lighting tier 0, 2048-pixel shadow maps and a fixed 9:00 sun.
The reported `mp/ffa3` view and a nearby camera position lost the ground bands
while retaining the ship and wall shadows; an `mp/ffa1` interior comparison
showed no obvious regression. GPU frame means were 3.336 → 3.341 ms for the
nearby `ffa3` view and 4.122 → 4.125 ms for `ffa1` (64 measured frames each).
These isolated captures are not a full gameplay benchmark or coverage of every
map, sun angle, graphics backend or shadow quality setting.

Sun-shadow cascades share a world-space reconstruction footprint while blending.
The close transition covers the last half of its axial range; the view/far
transition covers the last quarter. The minimum footprint is based on 1.5 texels
of the active cascade, interpolated toward the finer map during a transition.
This avoids cross-fading independently sharp and soft versions of an edge.
The accepted transition refinement added approximately 0.074 ms of GPU work in
the marked 4K ship view on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT, tier 0, HDR,
2048-pixel shadow maps, 16 base taps, fixed 11:00 sun). It does not establish
complete temporal invariance.

Static world and moving casters now keep separate depths in the close and view
cascades. A nearby player cannot replace a distant building's depth in the world
filter's separation estimate. Receivers multiply the independently filtered
visibilities. This approximates their union; it is not exact area-light visibility
for multiple blocker depths. Volumetric lighting samples both depths at each tap.
Tiers 0/1 reuse the existing static maps without copying them under moving casters.
Tier 2 refreshes separate world maps each frame, adding two depth textures
(32 MiB at 2048 pixels, 128 MiB at 4096) and two render-pass boundaries.

World penumbra width still grows with caster-to-receiver separation. The blocker
search bilinearly reconstructs positive gaps and coverage from 16 positions,
correcting for the receiver plane at each texel. Its reach is 24 world units,
expanded if needed for the minimum reconstruction footprint; it no longer clips
the close cascade's broad penumbrae at twelve tiny shadow texels. Reconstruction
uses a truncated Gaussian disk to reduce the visible rim of an equal-weight disk.
`jkr_shadowTaps` (4–32) supplies the base count, with up to four times that budget
for broad filters and a fractional final tap for continuous count changes.
The full-texel slope correction and small normal offset remain unchanged.

Moving casters use the shared contact footprint, independently of the building's
penumbra. Their shadows therefore remain comparatively sharp even when a moving
caster is high above its receiver. Actor-only shadow mode retains separation-based
filtering. Neither approach resolves all shadow-map occlusion or sampling limits.

The preceding combined-map RMS filter was rejected in owner playtesting: the
reported ground-fixed boundary and player interaction remained visible, especially
when structures were far from the surface receiving their shadow. The current
separation/filter changes were checked at the third `mp/ffa3` mark
`(-425.691, -1061.451, 73.832)`, yaw `132.718`, pitch `38.102`, with an external
release harness carrying the production shadow code from the working tree based
on `980e693`. Linux/RADV captures on the same RX 9060 XT at 1080p and 4K,
HDR, tier 0, 2048 maps, 16 base taps and fixed 11:00 sun showed a smoother broad
edge. A frozen Kyle model was moved through seven positions in the actual dynamic
caster pass. GPU attribute readback found no visibility increase on unchanged
receivers when adding the actor (over 515,000 compared pixels per position).
The previous combined-map filter's maximum increase was only 0.000119 in this
particular probe; the more visible improvement is the distinct player shadow
instead of its inheriting the building's broad blur. This is not a complete
reproduction of every reported player interaction.

Earlier wall/ship views and a seven-position camera approach were also captured.
Tier 2, day/night disabled and actor-only modes passed GPU smoke checks. At 4K,
64-frame means compared with the preceding combined-map filter were
1.579 → 2.100 ms for the light pass and 4.212 → 4.700 ms for GPU work excluding
capture/readback, approximately 0.49 ms added. These are empty-scene measurements
on an active desktop, with release compilation running concurrently, not a
populated-match benchmark. Workspace build/tests, formatting and the production
release build passed; Cargo runs no bundled regression tests. The owner accepted
the release playtest on 2026-10-02. Broader live-animation checks, other GPUs and
exhaustive quality/map coverage remain open.

## Entity render effects

cgame custom shaders on actors (force shells, pickup placeholders) are extra
instances of the same mesh in [entity_materials.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/entity_materials.rs).
The same path also draws rd-vanilla's `RF_FORCE_ENT_ALPHA`: the mesh keeps its
own surface shaders, the stage program replaces vertex alpha with the
instance's alpha, and each stage uses an alpha-blended, depth-tested,
non-depth-writing variant of its pipeline
([world_forced_alpha.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_forced_alpha.rs)).
Like rd-vanilla's fixed `GL_State`, the variant has no alpha test: the stage
program is specialized to skip it, so a GE128 cut-out whose forced alpha is
below one half stays visible, and blending still hides its transparent texels.
These draws close the blended entity list, like the stock post-render queue,
but particle effects still composite after them. Model materials compile these
variants at map load (depth-tested only); stages without an alpha test share
keys with ordinary blended stages.

The Force Speed afterimages use it: two copies of the actor in its current pose
at alpha 100 and 50, spaced by `(int)(6 * speed * 0.004)` units along the
recent path, while the entity has `PW_SPEED` and `cg_speedTrail` is nonzero
([speed_trail.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/speed_trail.rs), after
`cg_players.c:10841-10906`). Copies are excluded from shadow casting. The
mind-trick fade that also suppresses stock trails is not drawn by the viewer,
so only an active trick suppresses them. The `PW_SPEED` saber trail
(`cg_players.c:7319`) is not implemented. This has passed unit tests only;
appearance has not yet been checked on a GPU against the stock client.

Set `JKR_FRAME_BUDGET=1` for frame-work and GPU-phase diagnostics. Measurements
must name the build mode, GPU, resolution, settings, map and population. Separate
loading/shader warmup from steady frames and CPU work from GPU timings. The
500+ FPS target remains open; neither a single GPU timestamp nor an uncapped
empty scene demonstrates it.

## Saber trails

[saber_trail.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail.rs) follows codemp
`CG_AddSaberBlade` and `CTrail`: every frame at least 3 ms after the last, a
blade adds one slice from its remembered muzzle and tip to the current ones.
A slice lives `trailLen / 5` ms of the current `saberMove` (30–40 ms for most
moves, 40 ms when the move authors none) and fades by scrolling the clamped
blur texture, not by alpha. The short visible arc is stock behavior; frame rate
changes the slice count, not the arc's duration. Slices split along new tip to
old muzzle as `CTrail::Draw` does. With `cg_saberContact` on, the tip stops at
the first world surface the blade enters
([saber_trail_edge.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail_edge.rs)); stock
also stops it at solid brush entities, which JKR does not trace yet. A flying
primary saber trails and shares the owner's blade state, as in stock. Not yet
drawn: the extra trails stock adds while `PW_SPEED` is set with `cg_speedTrail`
and during super-break win animations.

Blade/wall contact ([saber_contacts.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_contacts.rs))
plays a wall-hit sound once a blade has stayed in the wall since the previous
frame, at most every 100 ms per blade. Like stock's `S_StartSound(..., -1,
CHAN_WEAPON, ...)`, all wall hits share one source and channel, so each new hit
replaces the previous one instead of overlapping it.

Static sun cascades carry a small min/max depth atlas: one pair of full-precision
bounds per 64×64 shadow texels, with separate view, close and far layers. A layer
is rebuilt immediately after its source map changes. Receivers bound the entire
possible filter footprint, including bilinear neighbours and receiver-plane
variation. Only footprints proved fully lit or fully blocked bypass the blocker
search and Gaussian reconstruction; uncertain footprints run the existing filter.
Moving-caster filtering is unchanged. At 2048 resolution the atlas occupies
24 KiB. Coalesced tile reads keep rebuilding practical in tier 2 as well as the
held-cascade modes. Golden-angle sample directions are constant shader data;
sample counts, radii, weights and cascade transitions are unchanged.

Real-time world shading skips baked-lightmap texture reads when the composition
hook replaces their RGB. Uploaded BSP lightmaps and their fallback have alpha
one; authored image alpha and animation still follow their normal paths.
The expensive main-view and floor-reflection material passes also prime depth for static surfaces
whose first stage guarantees opaque coverage. Deforms, sprites, alpha tests,
polygon offsets and special depth/blend modes keep their ordinary path. Depth
priming reuses the existing visibility ranges and indirect argument storage,
with direct draws as a fallback. It is limited to active real-time lighting;
reflections use their own camera, depth target, receiver frustum and scissor.

Camera-range caches also retain their PVS/area selection independently of the
camera frustum. Turning or moving within a cluster rechecks bounds but reuses
the same candidate indices; a source-cluster, area-mask or PVS-mode change
invalidates that selection. Storage is reserved at map load, at one index per
static draw. Unbounded and blended materials keep direct traversal.

External release replay checks compared these changes with `b4debe4` on
Linux/RADV, Ryzen 5 5500 and Radeon RX 9060 XT. Each recording contains 31
player profiles on `mp/ffa3` or `mp/ffa1`; 19–23 and 16–27 actor groups,
respectively, were evaluated during the measured routes. Settings were render
scale 1, HDR, day/night held at 11:00, lighting tier 0, 2048 shadow maps, 16 base
taps, volumetrics 1 and anisotropy 16. After five seconds of replay warmup,
6,660 frames sampled a 20-second route at 333 simulated frames per second.

| Replay / resolution | GPU mean before → after | Total frame mean before → after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mp/ffa3`, 3840×2160 | 5.302 → 4.575 ms | 5.473 → 4.746 ms |
| `mp/ffa1`, 3840×2160 | 6.714 → 5.808 ms | 6.894 → 5.983 ms |
| `mp/ffa3`, 2560×1080 | 2.026 → 1.845 ms | 2.499 → 2.474 ms |

These are offscreen full-frame replays, with no per-frame readback or capture
copy and no live network/audio output. They show a CPU limit at the smaller
resolution, not achievement of the 2 ms total-frame goal. Native presentation,
live matches, other GPUs and exhaustive community-content coverage remain open.

External GPU instrumentation compared the conservative shadow result with the
full filter at 656,749,476 accepted samples across both maps, moving sunlight,
tier 2, 1025-pixel shadow maps with 32 base taps, and 4K output. Maximum
visibility error was 0.00000012; none exceeded the 0.000002 verification threshold.
Twenty 4K scene snapshots across both routes retained the reference appearance;
one snapshot's kill-feed expiry differed with wall-clock timing. Baked lighting
and actor-only captures matched byte for byte. Fullbright, lightmap debug and
the non-table/direct-draw fallback also passed GPU and image checks. These
finite samples are not exhaustive image equivalence for every view or material.

Formatting, locked workspace build/tests and the release client build passed.
Cargo still runs no bundled regression suite. A native 1280×720 `mp/ffa3` static
map run rendered for a 45-second process lifetime without panic or GPU validation
error, using an isolated config. This is an integration smoke check, not a
populated-match performance result. The combined retained changes also completed a
45-second native `ffa1` crowd-replay process run with an isolated configuration
and no panic or GPU validation error. Concurrent compilation makes that latter
run an integration check only.

A follow-up CPU cache comparison used the same routes/settings at 2560×1080:
`ffa3` world-pass encoding fell from 0.565 to 0.513 ms and total frame mean from
2.462 to 2.420 ms. `ffa1` encoding fell from 0.884 to 0.866 ms; its total mean
was essentially unchanged (3.119 to 3.131 ms). An external verifier matched
3,178,666 cached/direct range results across the replays and forced area-mask,
source-cluster and missing-PVS transitions. Twenty further 4K captures retained
the scene appearance, with small pixel differences and the known wall-clock
kill-feed difference. This is finite coverage, not a universal cache proof.

Floor-reflection depth priming was compared in alternating order on the first
10 seconds of the `ffa1` route at 4K (3,330 frames per run, two runs per variant).
Mean GPU time was 5.453 → 5.417 ms; the reflected-plane phase was
1.116 → 1.081 ms. On the full 20-second route at 2560×1080, total frame means
were 3.135 → 3.094 ms. Twenty 4K captures across both maps showed only small
pixel differences (maximum 8/255), with the shadow filter and reflection
resolution unchanged. Paired 4K `ffa3` runs measured essentially unchanged
GPU time (4.547 versus 4.550 ms), with almost no floor-reflection work on that
route. Other mirror/portal types retain their previous path.

Particle stage selection borrows the atlas and evaluates stages as they are
consumed, retaining the existing eight-stage cap, order, animation, waveform,
texture transforms and missing-shader fallback. This avoids filling and copying
eight samples for every effect, including callers that only need the first.
The sampling implementation lives outside the frame-orchestration module.
Paired 3,330-frame `ffa3` runs at 2560×1080 reduced billboard preparation from
about 0.067 to 0.047 ms and effect geometry preparation from 0.034 to 0.029 ms.
Total-frame differences were within run variation; this is a CPU phase result.
An external comparison matched 3,360 stage samples bit for bit across both
loaded atlases and missing, empty and over-capacity shader cases.


Entity sorting caches each source material's immutable shader sort and first-stage
pipeline keys at material creation, including late custom materials. It preserves
missing-material defaults, opaque tie-breaking and back-to-front blend order;
per-frame draw records and allocation behavior are unchanged. Alternating
6,660-frame runs at 2560×1080 reduced instance preparation from about 0.092 to
0.078 ms on `ffa3` and 0.085 to 0.075 ms on `ffa1`. Total-frame differences were
within run variation. An external comparison matched 1,362,200 ordered draw
entries against the original comparator across both routes. Twenty further 4K
captures retained the scene appearance (one pixel differed by 12/255; all others
by at most 8/255).
The draw queue also classifies stage-major eligibility once when a draw is added,
rather than repeating material lookups in every colour pass. Missing materials
and depth-less draws retain their previous handling, and the 32-byte draw size is
unchanged on the measured 64-bit build. Two alternating 6,660-frame runs per
variant reduced CPU world-pass encoding by roughly 0.011 ms on `ffa3` and
0.016 ms on `ffa1`; total means fell by 0.034 and 0.026 ms respectively. The
same external verifier checked every cached classification and all material keys,
including missing-key defaults, across both replays; 20 captures showed only
small pixel differences (maximum 13/255 at one pixel).

Volumetric integration carries each slice's end depth into the following slice
instead of recomputing the same boundary. Sample locations and accumulated
scattering retain their existing arithmetic. Paired 3,330-frame 4K runs on both
routes saved about 0.0033 ms in the volumetric phase; 20 captures retained the
scene appearance, with small pixel differences (maximum 12/255 at one pixel).

Ambient occlusion reuses the fixed 16 sample directions and radii, preserving their
f32 expressions, sample order, reach and strength. Depth reconstruction omits the
ray normalization that cancels in its intersection ratio and scales the degeneracy
guard accordingly. Paired 3,330-frame 4K runs reduced the AO pass from 0.369 to
0.344 ms on `ffa3` and 0.354 to 0.330 ms on `ffa1`; total GPU means fell by
0.023 and 0.026 ms. Twenty captures retained the scene appearance, with one pixel
differing by 12/255 and all others by at most 8/255. These are measurements on the
same Vulkan setup, not exhaustive equivalence across all maps and backends.

## Material maps

The optional material maps follow OpenJK rend2 (`codemp/rd-rend2`), so rend2
texture packs apply without conversion. Stage keywords (`ParseStage` in
`tr_shader.cpp`) are parsed by
[jkr-shader](../crates/jkr-shader/src/material.rs): `normalMap`,
`normalHeightMap`, `specMap`/`specularMap`, the packed `rmoMap`, `moxrMap` and
`ormMap` families, and `specularReflectance`, `specularExponent`, `gloss`,
`roughness`, `normalScale`, `specularScale`, `parallaxDepth` and `parallaxBias`.
Their order-dependent overrides are kept. rend2 selects a packed layout by
comparing the image name with the keyword, so `rmosMap`, `mosrMap` and `ormsMap`
load the three-channel layouts; JKR does the same. Without keywords,
[the lookup](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/material_map_images.rs) tries `<diffuse>_nh`
then `_n` for normals and `_specGloss`, ioquake3's `_s`, `_rmo` then `_orm` for
specular, as in rend2's `CollapseStagesToGLSL`. ioquake3's typed
`stage normalMap` stages are not supported. With the cvars off, the parser
records the keywords and nothing else changes: no image lookup, layout,
buffer or pipeline is created.

Maps apply to lightmapped world surfaces (static and inline movers) whose
lightmap and diffuse stages collapse into one opaque pass. On the retail
`mp/ffa1`, `mp/ffa3` and `mp/duel1` this covers 84–87% of world triangles;
`mp/siege_hoth` covers 52%. Vertex-lit surfaces, stacks that do not collapse,
effect stages, deforms, sprites and models (MD3, Ghoul2) keep their authored shading.
Each material-mapped stage compiles to its own pipeline key and a second bind
group; ordinary stages keep their pipelines, groups and stage-table records.

Map load computes [vertex frames](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/material_map_frames.rs)
for the flattened world only when a stage has maps: a tangent with handedness,
averaged over the triangles of patch and triangle-soup vertices, and the
light-grid direction (`R_CalcVertexLightDirs`/`R_LightDirForPoint`). They use 8
bytes per vertex. Building them for `mp/ffa3` (114,088 vertices) took about 24 ms
in a release test build. Maps are uploaded as linear RGBA8 with box-filtered mips.

Shading lives in [material_maps.wgsl](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/material_maps.wgsl):

- Baked lighting: rend2's lightmap response, with the light-grid direction in
  place of a deluxemap. The texel is taken as arriving along that direction,
  divided by the face's own cosine (at most 4x) and received by the mapped normal;
  the remainder stays ambient. A flat normal map reproduces the texel. Retail BSPs
  have no deluxemaps, so this is an approximation.
- Real-time lighting (`jkr_dayNight 1`): the sun share of the half-resolution
  light buffer is moved to the mapped normal per pixel, using the visibility the
  buffer keeps. It fades out toward the terminator, so mapped bumps never light a
  face turned from the sun or a shadowed texel. Lamps and probe bounce remain as
  the light pass evaluated them for the geometric normal. Without a specular map,
  the existing sun highlight and sky rim use the mapped normal.
- Specular maps use rend2's two paths: spec/gloss, and occlusion, roughness,
  metalness and specular with the albedo as metal colour. Highlights use rend2's GGX
  `CalcSpecular` for the sun or grid direction and for dynamic lights. They are
  added after the albedo and dynamic-light modulation. Occlusion darkens only the
  ambient share.
- Parallax uses rend2's 16 linear and 8 binary steps through the height.

As in rend2, frames come from the untransformed texture coordinates (`tcMod`
rotation misaligns them) and an `animMap` stage uses its first frame's maps.
Material-mapped stages stay off the stage table (which only real-time mode
uses): the CPU colour pass draws them with per-stage bind groups and pipelines.

The controls are sampled once, when the GPU context is created. A change after
that logs `<cvar> changed: restart the viewer to apply material maps`; the
configuration file setting them at startup does not. Each map load logs what
it found, for example `material maps (normal+specular+parallax): 429 stages,
429 normal, 57 parallax, 429 specular; frames for 77283 vertices in 18 ms`, or
`no stage of this map has maps` when the cvars are on and nothing was found.

### What to expect, and checking it

`r_materialMapsDebug` is live and draws only material-mapped stages (one uniform
branch in the material program; the ordinary programs do not change): 1 shows the
mapped world-space normal as colour, 2 tints each stage by the maps it found (red
parallax, green normal, blue specular, so normal plus specular is cyan), 3 shows
the normal map's relief, four times its departure from the face, on grey.
Surfaces without maps keep their ordinary look in every view, so 2 shows at a
glance which surfaces take maps.

The baked response is subtle by construction. rend2 credits all of a lightmap
texel to one direction, so a normal tilted by a small angle α changes the texel
by about tan θ · α, where θ is the angle between the face and the light-grid
direction. A face whose grid direction is more than 78° from its normal falls
back to that normal (`R_LightDirForPoint`) and then only darkens by 1 − cos α. On
the retail `mp/ffa3`, 59% of lightmapped vertices have a usable grid direction
(55% on `mp/duel1`), with a mean tan θ of 1.5 there. Maps generated for ffa3
and duel1 by `jkr-materialgen` (strength 1) are gentle: their normals tilt 3.8°
on average (90th percentile 4–17° per image), so lighting changes by about 5%
on the surfaces that respond. A local headless render (not committed) of six
ffa3 spawn views at 960×540 (Vulkan, RTX 5080), with the generated maps and an
HD texture pack, measured against the cvars off: normal maps alone changed
pixels by 0.06–1.8/255 on average (at most 36/255), specular maps by
0.6–2.6/255 (at most 11/255; the generated `_rmo` maps average roughness 0.68
and metalness 0.02, so highlights are faint). Parallax changed pixels by up to
23/255 on average, but by shifting the texture: it reads as the same texture,
not as relief. Turning the cvars on in baked lighting therefore
shows no obvious change with these maps; that is the model, not a missing draw.
Authored rend2 packs with stronger normal maps respond in proportion to their
tilt.

Real-time lighting shows normal maps far more clearly: the sun share is moved
per pixel, and a low sun lights floors at grazing angles. With `jkr_dayNight 1`
and `jkr_dayHour 7`, the sun stands 15° high, so a floor's tan θ is about 3.7
(2.4 at the default hour 7.5) against 1.5 for baked grid directions. This
estimate is from the formulas above; no real-time render of real content has
been measured.

Unit tests cover keyword parsing, lookup order and conversions (synthetic
in-memory images), frames (planar, mirrored and curved), the stage selection
and the pipeline key. naga validates both material programs. A headless Vulkan
render of a synthetic quad on an RTX 5080 (Windows 11, external harness) checked
the response in both modes. Flat maps matched the ordinary program exactly, tilted
normals brightened and darkened as computed (green follows +t, rend2's
convention), and normal maps did not lighten a shadowed buffer texel.

The same harness timed one full-screen 3840×2160 layer (64 runs, medians):
baked lighting 0.103 ms ordinary, 0.196 with a normal map, 0.219 with a
specular map as well and 0.50 with parallax. With the light buffer, those passes
took 0.226, 0.30, 0.34 and 0.54 ms. Measure a real scene with `JKR_FRAME_BUDGET=1`
in a release build: compare the same map, view and population with the cvars on
and off. No authored rend2 pack was available for testing. Generated maps on
real ffa3 data were rendered headless in baked lighting only (above); real-time
lighting on real content, an in-game image and the frame cost in a match remain
unverified.

## Submission and lighting work reduction

The renderer records uploads with their frame and hands completed batches to a
submission thread. It finishes outstanding encoder work, applies those uploads,
submits and presents in order while the render thread prepares the next frame.
Only one handed-off frame can remain outstanding. With an offscreen scene target,
swapchain acquisition happens after world recording; direct-to-surface rendering
still acquires its image first. Resize, out-of-band submissions and teardown wait
for the outstanding batch. `JKR_SUBMIT_THREAD=0` selects inline submission as a
fallback. See [frame_queue.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_queue.rs),
[frame_split.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_split.rs) and
[frame_target.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_target.rs).

Upload staging reuses byte and operation storage after warmup. Queue clones share
a synchronized recording; this replaces immediate wgpu upload work on the render
thread, rather than making all queue operations lock-free. Large load-time writes
can bypass recording once pending submissions have completed.

The in-game HUD shader is restricted to crosshair and damage-indicator regions.
Intersecting regions become one rectangle so translucent pixels blend once.
Menus and the shader's status-bar fallback retain full-screen coverage.

Uncached deferred-light receivers are collected into a pixel list and shaded by
four compute lanes per receiver. Cached receivers keep their existing path. The
indirect dispatch uses bounded rows to support large light buffers; the final lamp
sum can differ slightly in floating-point rounding from a serial sum. Receiver
depth identifies valid texels, allowing attribute and light targets to retain data
outside regions that will be overwritten or sampled. Floor mirrors use separate
light images, preserving the main view without save/restore copies.

Static sun-shadow bounds form an exact min/max mip hierarchy, starting at 8-texel
tiles. A receiver chooses a level covering its filter footprint with at most four
tiles. It skips the existing filter only when those conservative bounds determine
the result; shadow radii, tap counts, cascades and visual settings are unchanged.


Verification on 2026-10-02 compared this change against `f3f3db2`, using external
release replay instrumentation on Linux, Ryzen 5 5500 and Radeon RX 9060 XT
(RADV). Each 2560×1080 run measured 3,330 frames after replay warmup, with a
31-player roster and unchanged graphics settings; visible/submitted actors ranged
from 20–23 on `ffa3` and 16–27 on `ffa1`.

| Route | Mean total frame | Mean GPU | Total-frame p99 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mp/ffa3` | 2.464 → 1.822 ms | 1.780 → 1.697 ms | 3.517 → 3.316 ms |
| `mp/ffa1` | 3.042 → 2.157 ms | 2.337 → 1.986 ms | 3.757 → 4.263 ms |

These paired offscreen runs establish a mean improvement on the sampled routes,
not universal sub-2 ms performance or improved tail latency. The `ffa1` p99 was
higher despite its lower mean; longer native play and more hardware remain open.
They exclude live networking/audio and window presentation. Comparison captures
at 2560×1080 and 3840×2160 retained the scene appearance: maximum channel error
was 4/255 on `ffa3`, 1/255 on `ffa1` outside its wall-clock kill-feed text, and
3/255 in the 4K `ffa1` snapshot. This is finite image coverage.

External checks covered overlapping HUD regions and viewport bounds at five
resolutions through 8K, indirect-dispatch boundary cases and 7,308 shadow-bound
footprints including non-power-of-two maps. Formatting, locked workspace build
and tests, and release client/server builds passed. Verification harnesses and
reports are kept outside the source repository.
Two 45-second native `ffa1` replay process runs also passed without panic or GPU
validation errors: threaded submission with HDR/FXAA, and inline submission with
HDR/FXAA disabled to exercise direct surface acquisition. Both used isolated
1280×720 settings; these are integration checks, not performance measurements.

## Sky scenery and hillside orientation

Local correction on 2026-10-03, based on `8f692ac` plus the preceding lighting
preview, addresses the three reported `t1_danger` views.

Indirect draw storage now resets during scene preparation, before either sky or
main-view commands are recorded. Resetting in the main sun-caster pass could reuse
an earlier sky view's buffer region: queued main-view uploads then changed the
sky draw arguments on camera turns. The static world's identity instance also
permits sky-portal rendering, matching the table path when drawing directly or
falling back from indirect draws. Entity and mover visibility rules are unchanged.

Lighting now orients smoothed normals using the triangle plane reconstructed from
fragment position derivatives. Testing the smooth normal's own dot product with
the eye incorrectly flipped visible hillside normals at grazing angles, creating
camera-dependent dark bands. Pre-pass normals, receiver lighting, lamp-cache side
selection and material upsampling use the same geometric-side decision. This does
not change sun-shadow filter widths, exposure or source intensity.

External release GPU captures on Linux/RADV, Radeon RX 9060 XT, at 1280×720,
day hour 10.6 and unchanged owner graphics settings established:

- The unwanted dark bands disappeared in both marked terrain views. Disabling AO,
  contact shadows or sun maps separately did not remove the old bands.
- A 24-view sky test captured the first frame of each alternating camera turn,
  covering offsets through ±36 degrees. Restoring only the old buffer reset
  reproduced missing mountains in 12 views (over 100,000 affected pixels each).
  Corrected indirect and direct draws agreed within 11/255 maximum channel error;
  only one pixel across the 24 comparisons exceeded 8/255.
- The sampled `mp/ffa1` view differed by at most 1/255. The previous `mp/ffa3`
  structure-shadow mark differed by at most 22/255, with only 28 pixels above
  8/255. The sampled day/night-disabled `mp/ffa3` image was byte-identical.
- Settled GPU medians for the distant and close terrain views were respectively
  0.713 → 0.713 ms and 0.695 → 0.691 ms (11–12 samples per side). These fixed-view,
  nonexclusive measurements are not a populated-match performance certification.

Formatting, locked workspace build, all nine existing tests and doc-test targets,
and the optimized owner client build passed. Native owner confirmation and wider
map/hardware coverage remain open. Verification overlays and assets stay outside
versioned source.

## UI ownership

`jkr-ui` provides renderer-independent retained widgets. The viewer supplies GPU
and text integration and binds client state to the HUD. Layouts are data in
[assets/hud](../crates/jkr-viewer/assets/hud); menus and HUD may be modern while
movement, combat and network behavior remain compatible.

## Billboard icons

Frame billboard icons follow OpenJK's `RT_SPRITE` image orientation: texture v=0
belongs at the top of the quad. Their local v is reflected before the shader's
scale/scroll transform; ordinary FX billboards retain their existing convention.
This covers simple-item icons and player-status icons when submitted through
that path. The owner reported an inverted talk balloon during the player-icon
PR playtest. An external probe compared the corrected production transform with
OpenJK `RB_AddQuadStampExt`: four corners with three scale/scroll transforms
matched, while ordinary FX transforms were unchanged. Native visual confirmation
of the correction remains pending.

World icons (talk/connection and simple-item sprites) preserve their authored
texture alpha even when `jkr_softParticles` is enabled. They use a distinct
instance kind to bypass the 16-unit intersection fade, while retaining ordinary
depth testing, orientation and bounded effect-pass coverage. Smoke and other FX
quads still soften against nearby surfaces. Applying the smoke fade to icons
made opaque bubble interiors transparent near geometry.

## Generating material maps

`jkr-materialgen` writes normal, height and roughness/metalness/occlusion maps
for the world textures of the player's own installation, in the rend2 naming
that the optional material maps (`r_normalMapping`, `r_specularMapping`,
`r_parallaxMapping`) look up next to a diffuse image. It runs offline and only
reads the game data; [its crate documentation](../crates/jkr-materialgen/src/lib.rs)
and `--help` are the reference.

```sh
cargo run --release -p jkr-materialgen -- --maps mp/ffa3,mp/duel1
```

- **Input.** GameData is found like the client finds it (`--game-data`,
  `JKR_GAME_DATA`, the config's `fs_gameData`, then the usual Steam paths).
  `base`, an optional `--fs-game` directory and `JKR_CONTENT` are mounted in
  the client's order, case-insensitive. The tool's own earlier output is left
  out. The installed maps (or `--maps`) supply the shaders actually drawn: BSP
  shader lumps and surfaces plus the shader scripts.
- **Selection** ([select.rs](../crates/jkr-materialgen/src/select.rs)). A texture
  qualifies when a shader draws it on lightmapped surfaces with lightmap and
  diffuse stages that collapse into one opaque pass. These are the stages the
  renderer gives maps to. Skipped, each with a reason in the manifest: sky,
  fog, liquids, nodraw/clip/system shaders, interface and 2D images,
  lightmaps, blend-only effects, `deformVertexes`, glowing, animated,
  environment-mapped and non-plain colour stages, alpha-tested foliage (grates
  are allowed), images without relief (flat colours) and textures that already
  have rend2 maps. With an existing normal map or specular map only the
  missing kind is written.
- **Generation** ([generate.rs](../crates/jkr-materialgen/src/generate.rs)),
  deterministic and wrap-around, so tiling textures stay seamless. Height comes
  from luminance, high-passed twice at 1/8 of the texture to suppress baked
  lighting gradients. It is then weighted by scale band and normalised.
  Normals are Scharr slopes (red +s, green +t down the image, rend2's frame),
  scaled by the class strength. Above 512 texels they are taken per 1/512 of
  the texture, so high-resolution replacements do not turn texel noise into
  steep bumps. The packed map
  holds roughness from the class plus local variation, brightness and cavities;
  metalness only on bright, unsaturated texels; and cavity occlusion. Source
  resolution is kept unless `--max-size` caps it, and alpha-tested textures
  keep their alpha in the normal map.
- **Classes** ([classes.rs](../crates/jkr-materialgen/src/classes.rs)): one table
  of strength, parallax, roughness, metalness and occlusion per class. A class is
  chosen by the BSP material id (`q3map_material`), then path keywords, then
  `surfaceparm metalsteps`. Stone, tiles and ground get `<texture>_nh`
  (height in alpha for parallax); the rest `<texture>_n`.
- **Specular layout.** The tool writes `<texture>_rmo` (red roughness, green
  metalness, blue occlusion) rather than `_specGloss`. The heuristics produce
  roughness and metalness directly, and the packed path takes the metal colour
  from the albedo and a 0.04 dielectric reflectance by itself, without rend2's
  SDR gloss conversion. Metalness stays at most 0.3: in that path metal loses
  its diffuse share, and nothing reflects the surroundings back into it.
- **Output.** One pk3 of PNGs plus `jkr-materialgen/manifest.json` (every
  source, its outputs, class, maps and shaders, skipped shaders with reasons,
  all settings). The archive is deterministic. The default path is
  `<JKR user data>/generated/zzz_jkr_materials.pk3`, `%APPDATA%\jkr\generated`
  on Windows. The tool refuses to write into the game installation. To use it,
  set `JKR_CONTENT` to that directory (the client mounts it above the game
  data), or copy the pk3 into `GameData/base` by hand; the `zzz_` name loads
  after the retail pk3s. `--dry-run` lists the choices, and `--limit`
  takes only the most-used textures.

The generated images are derived from retail textures. They stay on the
player's machine and must not be shared, uploaded or committed; the tests use
synthetic images only.

Heuristics fail where luminance is not relief. Painted stripes, signs and
decals become bumps. Lighting baked at panel scale (bright bevel edges, dark
undersides) becomes a ridge and a groove instead of a raised panel. Dark
grime reads as a dent, and smooth gradients within an eighth of the texture
remain. Unit tests cover flat input, slope direction, seams, gradient
suppression, alpha, class lookup, skip rules on synthetic scripts and the pk3
layout. A read-only run on `mp/ffa3` and `mp/duel1` of a Windows installation
with high-resolution texture packs took 11 s for 110 textures (160 MiB) and is
described in the generator's pull request. No in-game image has been checked.

## Default visual profile

New profiles use the owner-approved rendering setup: day/night enabled at a fixed
11:00, volumetrics quality 3, actor/world sun shadows at 2048 resolution and
16 filter taps, and lighting tier 0 (available baked indirect light under the
live sun). Shadow gap closure and screen-space contact shadows are off.
The scene uses HDR with exposure 1, FXAA, SSAO at strength 4, trilinear mipmapping
and 16× anisotropy where supported. Bloom and the optional LDR tone curve are off.
Soft particles, per-pixel model diffuse lighting and full rendering resolution
remain enabled. These are ordinary cvar defaults, not a config imported at launch.

Saved values take precedence, including explicitly disabled effects. Existing
profiles are not silently migrated. Resolution/window mode, input and keyboard
layout, FPS caps, audio levels, HUD/crosshair preferences, player identity,
server history, credentials and filesystem locations retain their independent
defaults. Stale MSAA/light-scale entries and the parked dust experiment are not
part of this profile; the active antialiasing path is FXAA.

External release/Vulkan validation on RX 9060 XT checks 36 graphics values with
an empty config, an explicit equivalent config and an existing override config.
Fresh FFA5 and FFA1 scenes rendered successfully. See [status](status.md) for the
image comparison result and validation limits. No personal config or assets are
included in the repository.
