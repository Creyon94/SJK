# Rendering and UI

The wgpu renderer lives in `jkr-viewer`. JKA content enters through owned BSP,
model and shader data; GPU resources stay in the viewer. The renderer consumes
BSP geometry, PVS visibility, lightmaps, shader stages and legacy models.

## Where to work

| Area | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| GPU/device setup | [gpu_context.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/gpu_context.rs) |
| World loading | [world_load.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_load.rs) |
| World materials | [world_materials.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_materials.rs) |
| Main scene passes | [main_scene_pass.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/main_scene_pass.rs) |
| Secondary views | [scene_views.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/scene_views.rs) |
| Sun and real-time lighting | [sun_shadows.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadows.rs) |
| Post processing | [post_aa.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_aa.rs) |
| Frame timing | [frame_pacing.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/frame_pacing.rs) |
| HUD integration | [hud.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/hud.rs) |

The normal BSP path supports additional lighting, shadows, GI probes, ambient
occlusion, reflections and post processing. Feature presence does not establish
correctness on every map or GPU. Preserve the ordinary BSP/material path when
working on optional effects and validate shared WGSL programs on an actual GPU.

## Selected controls

| Cvar | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `jkr_dayNight` | Map-relative sun/sky atmosphere; default 0, restart required |
| `jkr_realtime` | Lighting tier; default 2. Tier 1 retains world shadow casters between frames; tier 0 also uses available baked indirect light. Applies at map load |
| `jkr_dayHour` | Solar hour, updated live when day/night resources are installed |
| `jkr_dayMinutes` | Minutes per simulated day; 0 holds the hour |
| `jkr_hdr` | Scene precision: 0 display format, 1 RGBA16F; restart required |
| `jkr_hdrExposure` | Fixed exposure multiplier, 0.25–4; restart required |
| `jkr_dust` | Floating dust motes, 0 (off, default) to 1; live; Game settings tab |

See [day_night.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/day_night.rs),
[sun_shadow_settings.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/sun_shadow_settings.rs) and
[post_hdr.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/post_hdr.rs). A lighting tier alone does not
enable the day/night system. HDR here describes the scene buffer and display
mapping, not a claim of HDR monitor output.

Dust motes ([dust_motes.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/dust_motes.rs)) are an
optional presentation effect for the main view. The shader derives up to 2048
motes from the instance index and frame time, so the effect has no vertex or
instance buffer and no per-frame allocation; only a 16-byte uniform changes when
the light-grid colour at the camera does. Motes are fixed in world space within a
640-unit cube that wraps around the camera. They fade out beyond 150–300 units and
within 16–48 units of the eye. They depth-test against the world without writing
depth, after blended world and entity surfaces. Intensity scales both count and
opacity, which is capped at 0.35 for a mote's centre. In a headless offscreen
check at 960×540 with no occluding geometry, full intensity covered about 0.1% of
pixels above 5% opacity. To measure its cost, compare the `scene-pass` phase of
`JKR_FRAME_BUDGET=1` in a release build with `jkr_dust 0` and `jkr_dust 1` on the
same view. Per-map tuning is not implemented. The planned hook is a map-load
multiplier on the intensity. Motes do not test for solid or sky volumes
themselves; walls and other geometry hide motes behind them through the depth test.

Sun-shadow filtering compensates for the receiver surface's slope across the
full texel footprint of a linear depth comparison. A half-texel allowance only
covers samples midway between texel centers and can produce bands of false
self-shadowing on flat surfaces. Keep this allowance tied to the cascade's
texel size and receiver slope; increasing a fixed world-space offset can detach
shadows from walls and ground contacts.

The full-footprint correction was checked against the preceding shader from
`4a8fe31` with external release captures on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT), at
1920×1080 with HDR, lighting tier 0, 2048-pixel shadow maps and a fixed 9:00 sun.
The reported `mp/ffa3` view and a nearby camera position lost the ground bands
while retaining the ship and wall shadows; an `mp/ffa1` interior comparison
showed no obvious regression. GPU frame means were 3.336 → 3.341 ms for the
nearby `ffa3` view and 4.122 → 4.125 ms for `ffa1` (64 measured frames each).
These isolated captures are not a full gameplay benchmark or coverage of every
map, sun angle, graphics backend or shadow quality setting.

Sun-shadow cascades share a world-space reconstruction footprint while blending.
The close transition covers the last half of its axial range; the view/far
transition covers the last quarter. The minimum footprint is based on 1.5 texels
of the active cascade, interpolated toward the finer map during a transition.
This avoids cross-fading independently sharp and soft versions of an edge.
The accepted transition refinement added approximately 0.074 ms of GPU work in
the marked 4K ship view on Linux/RADV (Radeon RX 9060 XT, tier 0, HDR,
2048-pixel shadow maps, 16 base taps, fixed 11:00 sun). It does not establish
complete temporal invariance.

Static world and moving casters now keep separate depths in the close and view
cascades. A nearby player cannot replace a distant building's depth in the world
filter's separation estimate. Receivers multiply the independently filtered
visibilities. This approximates their union; it is not exact area-light visibility
for multiple blocker depths. Volumetric lighting samples both depths at each tap.
Tiers 0/1 reuse the existing static maps without copying them under moving casters.
Tier 2 refreshes separate world maps each frame, adding two depth textures
(32 MiB at 2048 pixels, 128 MiB at 4096) and two render-pass boundaries.

World penumbra width still grows with caster-to-receiver separation. The blocker
search bilinearly reconstructs positive gaps and coverage from 16 positions,
correcting for the receiver plane at each texel. Its reach is 24 world units,
expanded if needed for the minimum reconstruction footprint; it no longer clips
the close cascade's broad penumbrae at twelve tiny shadow texels. Reconstruction
uses a truncated Gaussian disk to reduce the visible rim of an equal-weight disk.
`jkr_shadowTaps` (4–32) supplies the base count, with up to four times that budget
for broad filters and a fractional final tap for continuous count changes.
The full-texel slope correction and small normal offset remain unchanged.

Moving casters use the shared contact footprint, independently of the building's
penumbra. Their shadows therefore remain comparatively sharp even when a moving
caster is high above its receiver. Actor-only shadow mode retains separation-based
filtering. Neither approach resolves all shadow-map occlusion or sampling limits.

The preceding combined-map RMS filter was rejected in owner playtesting: the
reported ground-fixed boundary and player interaction remained visible, especially
when structures were far from the surface receiving their shadow. The current
separation/filter changes were checked at the third `mp/ffa3` mark
`(-425.691, -1061.451, 73.832)`, yaw `132.718`, pitch `38.102`, with an external
release harness carrying the production shadow code from the working tree based
on `980e693`. Linux/RADV captures on the same RX 9060 XT at 1080p and 4K,
HDR, tier 0, 2048 maps, 16 base taps and fixed 11:00 sun showed a smoother broad
edge. A frozen Kyle model was moved through seven positions in the actual dynamic
caster pass. GPU attribute readback found no visibility increase on unchanged
receivers when adding the actor (over 515,000 compared pixels per position).
The previous combined-map filter's maximum increase was only 0.000119 in this
particular probe; the more visible improvement is the distinct player shadow
instead of its inheriting the building's broad blur. This is not a complete
reproduction of every reported player interaction.

Earlier wall/ship views and a seven-position camera approach were also captured.
Tier 2, day/night disabled and actor-only modes passed GPU smoke checks. At 4K,
64-frame means compared with the preceding combined-map filter were
1.579 → 2.100 ms for the light pass and 4.212 → 4.700 ms for GPU work excluding
capture/readback, approximately 0.49 ms added. These are empty-scene measurements
on an active desktop, with release compilation running concurrently, not a
populated-match benchmark. Workspace build/tests, formatting and the production
release build passed; Cargo runs no bundled regression tests. The owner accepted
the release playtest on 2026-10-02. Broader live-animation checks, other GPUs and
exhaustive quality/map coverage remain open.

## Entity render effects

cgame custom shaders on actors (force shells, pickup placeholders) are extra
instances of the same mesh in [entity_materials.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/entity_materials.rs).
The same path also draws rd-vanilla's `RF_FORCE_ENT_ALPHA`: the mesh keeps its
own surface shaders, the stage program replaces vertex alpha with the
instance's alpha, and each stage uses an alpha-blended, depth-tested,
non-depth-writing variant of its pipeline
([world_forced_alpha.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/world_forced_alpha.rs)).
These draws close the blended entity list, like the stock post-render queue,
but particle effects still composite after them. Model materials compile these
variants at map load (depth-tested only); most share keys with ordinary
blended stages.

The Force Speed afterimages use it: two copies of the actor in its current pose
at alpha 100 and 50, spaced by `(int)(6 * speed * 0.004)` units along the
recent path, while the entity has `PW_SPEED` and `cg_speedTrail` is nonzero
([speed_trail.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/speed_trail.rs), after
`cg_players.c:10841-10906`). Copies are excluded from shadow casting. The
mind-trick fade that also suppresses stock trails is not drawn by the viewer,
so only an active trick suppresses them. The `PW_SPEED` saber trail
(`cg_players.c:7319`) is not implemented. This has passed unit tests only;
appearance has not yet been checked on a GPU against the stock client.

Set `JKR_FRAME_BUDGET=1` for frame-work and GPU-phase diagnostics. Measurements
must name the build mode, GPU, resolution, settings, map and population. Separate
loading/shader warmup from steady frames and CPU work from GPU timings. The
500+ FPS target remains open; neither a single GPU timestamp nor an uncapped
empty scene demonstrates it.

Static sun cascades carry a small min/max depth atlas: one pair of full-precision
bounds per 64×64 shadow texels, with separate view, close and far layers. A layer
is rebuilt immediately after its source map changes. Receivers bound the entire
possible filter footprint, including bilinear neighbours and receiver-plane
variation. Only footprints proved fully lit or fully blocked bypass the blocker
search and Gaussian reconstruction; uncertain footprints run the existing filter.
Moving-caster filtering is unchanged. At 2048 resolution the atlas occupies
24 KiB. Coalesced tile reads keep rebuilding practical in tier 2 as well as the
held-cascade modes. Golden-angle sample directions are constant shader data;
sample counts, radii, weights and cascade transitions are unchanged.

Real-time world shading skips baked-lightmap texture reads when the composition
hook replaces their RGB. Uploaded BSP lightmaps and their fallback have alpha
one; authored image alpha and animation still follow their normal paths.
The expensive main-view and floor-reflection material passes also prime depth for static surfaces
whose first stage guarantees opaque coverage. Deforms, sprites, alpha tests,
polygon offsets and special depth/blend modes keep their ordinary path. Depth
priming reuses the existing visibility ranges and indirect argument storage,
with direct draws as a fallback. It is limited to active real-time lighting;
reflections use their own camera, depth target, receiver frustum and scissor.

Camera-range caches also retain their PVS/area selection independently of the
camera frustum. Turning or moving within a cluster rechecks bounds but reuses
the same candidate indices; a source-cluster, area-mask or PVS-mode change
invalidates that selection. Storage is reserved at map load, at one index per
static draw. Unbounded and blended materials keep direct traversal.

External release replay checks compared these changes with `b4debe4` on
Linux/RADV, Ryzen 5 5500 and Radeon RX 9060 XT. Each recording contains 31
player profiles on `mp/ffa3` or `mp/ffa1`; 19–23 and 16–27 actor groups,
respectively, were evaluated during the measured routes. Settings were render
scale 1, HDR, day/night held at 11:00, lighting tier 0, 2048 shadow maps, 16 base
taps, volumetrics 1 and anisotropy 16. After five seconds of replay warmup,
6,660 frames sampled a 20-second route at 333 simulated frames per second.

| Replay / resolution | GPU mean before → after | Total frame mean before → after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mp/ffa3`, 3840×2160 | 5.302 → 4.575 ms | 5.473 → 4.746 ms |
| `mp/ffa1`, 3840×2160 | 6.714 → 5.808 ms | 6.894 → 5.983 ms |
| `mp/ffa3`, 2560×1080 | 2.026 → 1.845 ms | 2.499 → 2.474 ms |

These are offscreen full-frame replays, with no per-frame readback or capture
copy and no live network/audio output. They show a CPU limit at the smaller
resolution, not achievement of the 2 ms total-frame goal. Native presentation,
live matches, other GPUs and exhaustive community-content coverage remain open.

External GPU instrumentation compared the conservative shadow result with the
full filter at 656,749,476 accepted samples across both maps, moving sunlight,
tier 2, 1025-pixel shadow maps with 32 base taps, and 4K output. Maximum
visibility error was 0.00000012; none exceeded the 0.000002 verification threshold.
Twenty 4K scene snapshots across both routes retained the reference appearance;
one snapshot's kill-feed expiry differed with wall-clock timing. Baked lighting
and actor-only captures matched byte for byte. Fullbright, lightmap debug and
the non-table/direct-draw fallback also passed GPU and image checks. These
finite samples are not exhaustive image equivalence for every view or material.

Formatting, locked workspace build/tests and the release client build passed.
Cargo still runs no bundled regression suite. A native 1280×720 `mp/ffa3` static
map run rendered for a 45-second process lifetime without panic or GPU validation
error, using an isolated config. This is an integration smoke check, not a
populated-match performance result. The combined retained changes also completed a
45-second native `ffa1` crowd-replay process run with an isolated configuration
and no panic or GPU validation error. Concurrent compilation makes that latter
run an integration check only.

A follow-up CPU cache comparison used the same routes/settings at 2560×1080:
`ffa3` world-pass encoding fell from 0.565 to 0.513 ms and total frame mean from
2.462 to 2.420 ms. `ffa1` encoding fell from 0.884 to 0.866 ms; its total mean
was essentially unchanged (3.119 to 3.131 ms). An external verifier matched
3,178,666 cached/direct range results across the replays and forced area-mask,
source-cluster and missing-PVS transitions. Twenty further 4K captures retained
the scene appearance, with small pixel differences and the known wall-clock
kill-feed difference. This is finite coverage, not a universal cache proof.

Floor-reflection depth priming was compared in alternating order on the first
10 seconds of the `ffa1` route at 4K (3,330 frames per run, two runs per variant).
Mean GPU time was 5.453 → 5.417 ms; the reflected-plane phase was
1.116 → 1.081 ms. On the full 20-second route at 2560×1080, total frame means
were 3.135 → 3.094 ms. Twenty 4K captures across both maps showed only small
pixel differences (maximum 8/255), with the shadow filter and reflection
resolution unchanged. Paired 4K `ffa3` runs measured essentially unchanged
GPU time (4.547 versus 4.550 ms), with almost no floor-reflection work on that
route. Other mirror/portal types retain their previous path.

Particle stage selection borrows the atlas and evaluates stages as they are
consumed, retaining the existing eight-stage cap, order, animation, waveform,
texture transforms and missing-shader fallback. This avoids filling and copying
eight samples for every effect, including callers that only need the first.
The sampling implementation lives outside the frame-orchestration module.
Paired 3,330-frame `ffa3` runs at 2560×1080 reduced billboard preparation from
about 0.067 to 0.047 ms and effect geometry preparation from 0.034 to 0.029 ms.
Total-frame differences were within run variation; this is a CPU phase result.
An external comparison matched 3,360 stage samples bit for bit across both
loaded atlases and missing, empty and over-capacity shader cases.

Entity sorting caches each source material's immutable shader sort and first-stage
pipeline keys at material creation, including late custom materials. It preserves
missing-material defaults, opaque tie-breaking and back-to-front blend order;
per-frame draw records and allocation behavior are unchanged. Alternating
6,660-frame runs at 2560×1080 reduced instance preparation from about 0.092 to
0.078 ms on `ffa3` and 0.085 to 0.075 ms on `ffa1`. Total-frame differences were
within run variation. An external comparison matched 1,362,200 ordered draw
entries against the original comparator across both routes. Twenty further 4K
captures retained the scene appearance (one pixel differed by 12/255; all others
by at most 8/255).
The draw queue also classifies stage-major eligibility once when a draw is added,
rather than repeating material lookups in every colour pass. Missing materials
and depth-less draws retain their previous handling, and the 32-byte draw size is
unchanged on the measured 64-bit build. Two alternating 6,660-frame runs per
variant reduced CPU world-pass encoding by roughly 0.011 ms on `ffa3` and
0.016 ms on `ffa1`; total means fell by 0.034 and 0.026 ms respectively. The
same external verifier checked every cached classification and all material keys,
including missing-key defaults, across both replays; 20 captures showed only
small pixel differences (maximum 13/255 at one pixel).

Volumetric integration carries each slice's end depth into the following slice
instead of recomputing the same boundary. Sample locations and accumulated
scattering retain their existing arithmetic. Paired 3,330-frame 4K runs on both
routes saved about 0.0033 ms in the volumetric phase; 20 captures retained the
scene appearance, with small pixel differences (maximum 12/255 at one pixel).

Ambient occlusion reuses the fixed 16 sample directions and radii, preserving their
f32 expressions, sample order, reach and strength. Depth reconstruction omits the
ray normalization that cancels in its intersection ratio and scales the degeneracy
guard accordingly. Paired 3,330-frame 4K runs reduced the AO pass from 0.369 to
0.344 ms on `ffa3` and 0.354 to 0.330 ms on `ffa1`; total GPU means fell by
0.023 and 0.026 ms. Twenty captures retained the scene appearance, with one pixel
differing by 12/255 and all others by at most 8/255. These are measurements on the
same Vulkan setup, not exhaustive equivalence across all maps and backends.

## Saber trails

[saber_trail.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail.rs) follows codemp
`CG_AddSaberBlade` and `CTrail`: every frame at least 3 ms after the last, a
blade adds one slice from its remembered muzzle and tip to the current ones.
A slice lives `trailLen / 5` ms of the current `saberMove` (30–40 ms for most
moves, 40 ms when the move authors none) and fades by scrolling the clamped
blur texture, not by alpha. The short visible arc is stock behavior; frame rate
changes the slice count, not the arc's duration. Slices split along new tip to
old muzzle as `CTrail::Draw` does. With `cg_saberContact` on, the tip stops at
the first world surface the blade enters
([saber_trail_edge.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_trail_edge.rs)); stock
also stops it at solid brush entities, which JKR does not trace yet. A flying
primary saber trails and shares the owner's blade state, as in stock. Not yet
drawn: the extra trails stock adds while `PW_SPEED` is set with `cg_speedTrail`
and during super-break win animations.

Blade/wall contact ([saber_contacts.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/saber_contacts.rs))
plays a wall-hit sound once a blade has stayed in the wall since the previous
frame, at most every 100 ms per blade. Like stock's `S_StartSound(..., -1,
CHAN_WEAPON, ...)`, all wall hits share one source and channel, so each new hit
replaces the previous one instead of overlapping it.

## UI ownership

`jkr-ui` provides renderer-independent retained widgets. The viewer supplies GPU
and text integration and binds client state to the HUD. Layouts are data in
[assets/hud](../crates/jkr-viewer/assets/hud); menus and HUD may be modern while
movement, combat and network behavior remain compatible.

UI text uses the bundled Inter font, rasterized once per display scale in
[text.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/text.rs). Two options switch surfaces to
the game's own bitmap fonts, read from the player's game data and never
bundled: `cg_classicHudFont` draws the status HUD with `arialnb`, and
`ui_gameFont` ("Game font for menus and chat", off by default) draws menus
with `ergoec` and chat with `ocr_a`, the retail menu and chat-box fonts. Their
`.fontdat` metrics are read by [fontdat.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/text/fontdat.rs);
the atlas is the highest-priority `fonts/<name>.tga` (or `.png`/`.jpg`), so an
HD replacement atlas in a later PK3 is used with the retail metrics and is
mipmapped down to the retail 512-texel size. The game fonts load when a world
is installed with the option on, or on first use, from
[game_font.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/game_font.rs); a missing font leaves
its surface on Inter.

### Menu readability

Menu screens draw their text straight over the live map, so a left-hand scrim
darkens the world behind the text column. The archived cvar `ui_menuContrast`
(Settings, GAME tab) sets how far that scrim is held under the text:

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | The original scrims; the in-game menu leaves the match untinted |
| `standard` (default) | Muted body text reaches WCAG AA (4.5:1) over a backdrop of relative luminance 0.5 (about sRGB `#bcbcbc`) |
| `strong` | All enabled text, the accent included, reaches 4.5:1 over pure white; dark custom accents are capped at 95% darkening |

With a level on, each scrim keeps its original fade but does not drop below
the required darkness until the right edge of the text column, then eases
back over 12% of the screen width. The in-game menu gets the player screen's
column scrim, centred cards and the map picker's caption get the same floor,
and dimmed labels gain just enough opacity to reach 4.5:1 on that backing.
Disabled entries (drawn under half opacity) keep their dimmed look. The
figures treat UI colours as linear values blended into an sRGB or float target
and ignore the glyph drop shadow, so they are conservative; they are not
measured on screen. See
[contrast.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/menu_widgets/contrast.rs) and
[hero.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/menu_widgets/hero.rs).

## Billboard icons

Frame billboard icons follow OpenJK's `RT_SPRITE` image orientation: texture v=0
belongs at the top of the quad. Their local v is reflected before the shader's
scale/scroll transform; ordinary FX billboards retain their existing convention.
This covers simple-item icons and player-status icons when submitted through
that path. The owner reported an inverted talk balloon during the player-icon
PR playtest. An external probe compared the corrected production transform with
OpenJK `RB_AddQuadStampExt`: four corners with three scale/scroll transforms
matched, while ordinary FX transforms were unchanged. Native visual confirmation
of the correction remains pending.
