# Status and priorities

Reviewed 2026-10-01 against source baseline `0d215f1`.

JKR currently contains a native client and standard dedicated server in a
20-crate Rust workspace. This page records scope and verification, rather than
claiming complete parity from the presence of an implementation.

## Implemented scope

- PK3/loose-file content, BSP maps/collision, legacy models and shader scripts.
- Protocol-26 client/server sessions, shared JKA game rules and client prediction.
- Graphical client with browser, menus/settings, HUD, console, audio, screenshots,
  demos and a Create game flow.
- wgpu BSP renderer with optional modern lighting and post processing.
- Dedicated-server game integration, console/configuration, stock game-type
  options, map entities, bots/NPCs and script integration.

Entry points and ownership are linked from [architecture.md](architecture.md).
The lists above describe source coverage; they do not close the validation gaps below.

## Verification recorded for this baseline

| Check | Result and scope |
| --- | --- |
| Linux workspace build, Cargo tests and formatting | Passed; no bundled regression tests currently run |
| Optimized client and dedicated-server build | Passed with Rust 1.96.1 on Linux |
| External OpenJK movement reference checks | 560 cases / 72,275 commands at 8/7/4/3 ms; movement, animation, events and compared wire fields matched |
| External player-angle checks | 125 samples matched the OpenJK reference |
| Local OpenJK client against JKR server | Joined `mp/ffa3`, walked, jumped and turned; no prediction misses observed in that run |
| Native Vulkan rendering | Local JKR client/server completed joined-map rendering on `mp/ffa3` with defaults and with day/night + lighting tier 2 + HDR; each continued for 15 seconds without panic or GPU validation error |

The reference checkout used for the external checks was OpenJK
`1a6a643427aa347553e9073dac5570b33337c4d9`, multiplayer `codemp`.
The external harnesses and raw reports are not part of this repository, so these
are recorded maintainer results, not checks reproducible by running `cargo test`
alone. The GPU runs used debug builds and establish startup/integration only;
they do not establish visual parity or release performance.

Sun-shadow correction (2026-10-02, based on `4a8fe31`): external release GPU
captures reproduced and removed ground self-shadow bands in the reported
`mp/ffa3` view, including a nearby camera position. An `mp/ffa1` comparison
showed no obvious regression. See [rendering](rendering.md) for settings,
timings and limits. The updated production release client also rendered
`mp/ffa3` on Linux/Vulkan (Radeon RX 9060 XT) with day/night and HDR enabled
without a panic or GPU validation error during a short startup check.
The owner also playtested the release build and confirmed that the reported
view looked clean.

Sun-shadow edge refinement (2026-10-02, based on `980e693`): the owner
accepted the release playtest with smoother structure shadows and more stable
player-shadow overlaps. Cascades share a reconstruction footprint and wider
transition bands. World and moving-caster depths are filtered independently;
a world-space blocker search and Gaussian reconstruction smooth broad edges
without letting a player change the building's separation estimate.

External release GPU evidence covers the three marked `mp/ffa3` views, camera
approaches and seven positions of an actor in the dynamic-caster pass. Adding
the actor did not brighten unchanged receivers in that probe. Tier 2, day/night
disabled and actor-only GPU smoke checks passed, as did formatting, workspace
build/tests and the release client build. The tested 4K view adds about 0.49 ms
of GPU work over the preceding playtest filter. See [rendering](rendering.md)
for settings, the overlap approximation, memory cost and remaining limits.

Performance work based on `b4debe4` (2026-10-02) preserves the accepted shadow
filter while skipping provably constant footprints, unused baked-lightmap reads
and hidden opaque shading. External 31-player replays show 4K GPU means falling
from 5.30 to 4.57 ms on `mp/ffa3` and 6.71 to 5.81 ms on `mp/ffa1`. At
2560×1080, `ffa3` GPU work is 1.85 ms but total frame time remains 2.47 ms:
the 2 ms target is still open. Shader reference comparisons, alternate-mode
captures, workspace checks and a native release smoke check passed; see
[rendering](rendering.md) for settings, evidence and limitations.
An additional PVS/area candidate cache reduced CPU world-pass encoding by
0.052 ms on the smaller `ffa3` replay and matched 3,178,666 direct-traversal
results, including forced visibility transitions. Its total-frame gain was
0.042 ms there; the reflection-heavy `ffa1` route was essentially unchanged.
Extending opaque depth priming to floor reflections then saved about 0.036 ms
of GPU work in paired 4K `ffa1` runs; lower-resolution timing and captures on
both maps also passed. Reflection resolution and shadow filtering are unchanged.
Lazy particle-stage sampling removes about 0.025 ms of measured effect preparation
on the `ffa3` replay; 3,360 sampled stage values matched the previous implementation
bit for bit. Its total-frame effect was within run variation.
Caching immutable material sort keys saves another 0.01–0.014 ms in instance
preparation on the two routes. The original comparator matched 1,362,200 ordered
draw entries; total-frame improvement remains below run variation.
Reusing each draw's stage-major classification removes a further 0.011–0.016 ms
of CPU world-pass encoding in paired runs, with unchanged draw storage size
and reference-checked classification.
Fixed AO sample tables and equivalent depth-ray arithmetic save another
0.023–0.026 ms of total GPU time in paired 4K runs, with unchanged AO settings
and checked captures on both routes. The owner playtested and accepted the
combined performance preview before publication.

## Open validation and limitations

- Complete server/gameplay parity remains unverified. Audit concrete scenarios
  across game types, combat, vehicles, NPCs, scripting and map transitions before
  marking individual capabilities complete.
- The client plays the sound events of a skeleton's `animevents.cfg`
  (`AEV_SOUND`/`AEV_SOUNDCHAN`, and the saber swing and spin sounds codemp makes
  of `saberhup`/`saberspin` lines) as actors' legs and torso reach their frames:
  [animation_events.rs](../crates/jkr-client/src/animation_events.rs), played by
  [audio_animation_events.rs](../crates/jkr-viewer/src/audio_animation_events.rs).
  These are the fast-style taunt's saber spins, saber kicks and katas, melee
  punches and body falls. Covered by unit tests and a parse of the retail
  humanoid file; not yet heard in game. Not played from the same file:
  `AEV_FOOTSTEP` (dry footsteps), `AEV_EFFECT`, `AEV_FIRE`, a saber's own
  `swingSound`/`spinSound`, and corpses' events. The stun baton, unlike melee,
  has a fire sound in the weapon table of
  [sound_events.rs](../crates/jkr-client/src/sound_events.rs).
- Snapshot entities draw a model from `modelindex` only for the entity types
  whose codemp cgame function does so; the per-type rules and their reference
  are in [entity_models.rs](../crates/jkr-client/src/entity_models.rs). Models
  codemp draws that the client still does not: force holocrons, non-brush
  `ET_MOVER` models and a mover's secondary `modelindex2` model, and the
  portable shield (`ET_SPECIAL`) and `ET_BEAM` effects.
- Mod compatibility is scoped by explicit profiles; broad BaseJKA/JA+/TaystJK
  feature parity is not established by profile detection.
- Community PK3 compatibility needs broader map/model coverage. One retail map
  cannot establish every shader, animation or content combination.
- Windows runtime behavior is largely unverified. Do not infer platform support
  from source conditionals alone. Windows reserves 1 MiB for the main thread and
  the client overflowed it after loading `mp/ffa3`; [the viewer build
  script](../crates/jkr-viewer/build.rs) now links Windows binaries with the
  8 MiB Linux size. On Windows 11 (Rust 1.96, MSVC), release and debug clients
  then loaded `mp/ffa3`, and a release client joined a local JKR server and
  completed its map load. Longer play, other maps and the GNU toolchain are unchecked.
- DX12 rendering is unverified. JKR does not select DX12 itself (Vulkan is preferred
  where present); with `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12` and no `dxcompiler.dll`, wgpu compiles
  shaders with FXC. A headless pipeline build of every entry point of the 39 viewer
  shader modules on DX12/FXC (Windows 11, RTX 5080, 2026-10-02) fails only for the
  HUD fragment program (error X3507: the function ends in `discard` without a
  return) and the GI probe update (error X4026: a workgroup barrier after
  storage-dependent early returns). The stage programs' skinning loop no longer
  fails with X3511.
- The 500+ FPS / roughly 2 ms frame target is not certified. Measure representative
  release workloads, including populated matches and chosen graphics settings.
- The repository does not bundle a regression suite. Required reference evidence
  must be supplied externally until an in-repository verification approach is agreed.

## Current priorities

1. Improve populated-match release frame times while preserving the owner-accepted
   appearance (owner priority, 2026-10-02). Target below 2 ms with 31 players;
   reaching that target is not a reason to stop investigating useful savings.
2. Stabilize normal client and dedicated-server use with reproducible local reports.
3. Audit compatibility gaps by subsystem and scenario; preserve exact combat and wire behavior.
4. Broaden community-content and platform validation.

These priorities guide requested work; they do not authorize an assistant to
start an unrelated task. Update this page when evidence or agreed priorities
change. For a new result, record the source revision, environment, scenario,
reference and limits. Keep resolved change history in Git rather than appending
session-by-session notes here.
