//! The resolution scale shared by 2D UI layouts.
//!
//! Menus, HUD, chat, scoreboard and console are authored in pixels of a
//! 1080-line screen and grow with the window height, as retail's 640x480
//! virtual screen did, so a layout looks the same at 1440 or 2160 lines as at
//! 1080. The operating system's display scale is deliberately not applied:
//! a fullscreen window already covers the display, so multiplying by it would
//! count the display density twice, and in a small window on a scaled desktop
//! it would push 1080-line layouts past the window edges. It only sets the
//! resolution the bundled font is rasterized at ([`crate::text::load_modern`]).
