//! An effect's `Flash` primitive (`CFlash`, OpenJK `codemp/client/FxPrimitives.cpp`):
//! a flash of the screen whose colour `CFlash::Init` scales by where the effect is from
//! the viewer when it starts. Full within a few units, fading with the square of the
//! distance to nothing at 900 units, and nothing beyond 60 degrees off the view axis
//! unless within 100 units. `demp2/altdetonate` has one (2048 units of
//! `gfx/effects/whiteFlash`): drawn at full colour wherever a DEMP2 shock went off, it
//! lit the whole screen from across the map (Slash, hub report #125).
//!
//! `CFlash::Draw` then draws it on the viewer, not where it went off: an `RT_SPRITE`
//! `FLASH_DISTANCE_FROM_VIEWER` (12) units along the view axis, of radius
//! `12 * tan(fov_x / 2)`, which spans the view's width and, on a screen wider than tall,
//! more than its height. Its size curve is ignored. `whiteFlash` is `$whiteimage`, added
//! (`blendFunc GL_ONE GL_ONE`) with `depthFunc disable` and `sort nearest`, so nothing
//! hides it. SJK draws that sprite as the clip-space quad [`screen_half_extents`] gives
//! (`entity.wgsl` kind 6), with the primitive's colour and alpha curves as stock's
//! `UpdateRGB`/`UpdateAlpha` give them. Drawn as a 2048-unit billboard at the shock, the
//! flash was hidden by everything nearer than it and tinted all behind it, the sky
//! included, up to a hard edge. `localizedFlash` (`FX_LOCALIZED_FLASH`, a 2D picture at
//! the effect's screen position) is not modelled: no retail effect uses it.
