//! Menu sound cues: hover, click and back posted by every menu canvas as it
//! routes input, the stage model's saber throw and catch posted by the
//! menu stage, all played once per frame by the audio owner.
//!
//! The posters live inside screens that have no audio access, so cues go
//! through one process-wide atomic mailbox. A cue is a bit, not a queue:
//! ten hovers in one frame play one tick, which is what a menu wants.
