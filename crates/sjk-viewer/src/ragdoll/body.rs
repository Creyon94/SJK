//! The Ragdoll toy's body: a limp humanoid of [`JOINTS`] points held together by sticks
//! (Verlet integration, as the sandbox games' first ragdolls), falling and tumbling
//! against the world.
//!
//! Every SJK client that hears of a fall runs this same simulation from the same start
//! ([`Start`]), in fixed steps of [`STEP_MS`] game server milliseconds counted from the
//! fall's moment, so all of them show the body in the same place without any pose being
//! sent: the start is one short relay event. The body's proportions are fixed, not the
//! player model's (a client that lacks the model draws another). The world's brushes
//! and its movers are in its way: a mover stands where its trajectory puts it at the
//! step's own moment ([`World::at`]), which every client that sees the mover reads the
//! same, so a lift carries the body and a closing door pushes it the same way everywhere.
//! Once every point has lain still for [`SLEEP_STEPS`] steps the body sleeps, until a
//! mover carries or pushes it again, or something strikes it.
//!
//! Since 26/10/2026 (the Monitor toy) the points weigh what the body's parts weigh
//! ([`MASSES`]: the sticks move a hand more than the pelvis), a surface holds a point by
//! Coulomb friction (what it presses into the surface sets how much of its slide it
//! loses, so a body thrown hard skids and tumbles on rather than stopping dead), the limbs
//! keep out of each other ([`Body::apart`]) and a [`Strike`] gives the whole body a push
//! at one of its points, at a given step, as a solid would take it: a blow to the head
//! turns it heels over head, one to the legs sweeps them from under it.
