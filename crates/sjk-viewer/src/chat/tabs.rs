//! The channels the chat composer offers (29/10/2026): All always,
//! then Team, SJK, Admin and PM, each behind its own switch, so every player sets up the
//! row they use. Admin is JA+'s and jaPRO's `amsay`, a message only the server's admins
//! read (JoF EJK `Cmd_Amsay_f`, `SAY_ADMIN`); it is offered only on a server whose mod
//! has the command, and has its own key ([`ADMIN_COMMAND`]). PM whispers to the last
//! player who whispered you (`chat/reply.rs`). A hidden channel is only left off the row
//! and out of Tab: its key still opens it, and a whisper still opens from a name.
//!
//! Each button is also a tab, as in other games' chat windows (Dave, 29/10/2026): while
//! the composer is on Team, SJK, Admin or a whisper, the feed shows only that channel's
//! messages (whispers both ways, encrypted ones too), and All shows everything; the
//! feed shows everything again once the composer closes. [`FILTER_CVAR`] turns it off:
//! every chat stays in view, each line labelled with its channel, and the buttons only
//! pick where the message goes.
//!
//! The clan chats (03/11/2026, Sol's decision from Lex's idea, `docs/hub-chat.md`
//! "Clan chats"): JoF and S, hub chats like SJK, have a button each once the player
//! joined them ([`JOF_JOIN_CVAR`], [`SITH_JOIN_CVAR`]; the hub says who may). Since then
//! every switchable button but PM takes a third value, 2: shown, but left out of Tab's
//! cycle ([`Shown`]), so a player keeps Team or Admin clickable without Tab stopping on
//! it.
