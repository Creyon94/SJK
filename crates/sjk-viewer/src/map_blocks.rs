//! Blocking for this map (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "Blocking for this map"): players blocked
//! until the server's map changes, as the PC-wide block does (`muted_players.rs`: Kyle,
//! silent, named BLOCKED), by this player alone or, by SJK staff, for every SJK player
//! there who follows staff blocks (`cl_staffBlocks`, `PROTOCOL.md` "Map blocks").
//!
//! A block names a slot and the name the game showed there. It follows that player
//! while they keep the slot, through renames, and ends when the slot empties (they
//! left) or the map load (`sv_serverid`) changes. A staff block reaches this client
//! with the hub's presence; it applies while the name in its slot matches the one the
//! staff saw, or the player this client saw it match renamed since. Lifting a staff
//! block here (`unblock`) lifts it for this player only, for the rest of the map.
