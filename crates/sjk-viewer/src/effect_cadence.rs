//! The rate at which continuously played legacy effects are re-played.
//!
//! Several cgame paths call `FX_PlayEffectID` on every rendered frame: the projectile
//! think (`CG_Missile`, `cg_ents.c:2943-2952`; e.g. `FX_RepeaterAltProjectileThink`,
//! `fx_heavyrepeater.c:141-155`), the muzzle-flash window (`cg_weapons.c:733-762`), the
//! item cone (`cg_ents.c:1950-1953`) and the force lightning/drain beam
//! (`cg_players.c:9408-9510`). Each call adds fresh primitives that live their authored life
//! (50 ms by default, `FxTemplate.cpp:51`), so the number of overlapping additive copies, and
//! with it how white and how wide the effect looks, grows with the frame rate.
//!
//! The reference look is TaystJK at `com_maxfps 125`, the engine default
//! (`shared/sys/sys_main.cpp:172-174`): a repeater alt orb then carries about six copies of
//! each sprite. JKR renders at 500 FPS and more, which stacked four times as many and turned
//! the orb into a flat white disc. These effects
//! are therefore re-played on a fixed 8 ms cgame cadence, independent of the render rate.
//! Everything else about them (lights, positions, lifetimes) is unchanged.
