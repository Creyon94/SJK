//! Achievements: milestones of the player's own play, shown on the Profile page's
//! board (`docs/identity.md`, "Achievements"). Like medals they grant nothing.
//!
//! Most are counted here, from what the client sees in its matches on servers
//! ([`tracker`]): players defeated, duels won, flags captured, maps and servers played,
//! time played. The counts are kept in `achievements.json` in the settings folder, so
//! they work with the identity off, and are sent to the SJK hub with it on, which keeps
//! them with the player's profile (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Achievements"). A few the hub counts
//! itself, from what the player did there (a bio, bug reports, world notes, medals).
//!
//! The hub cannot see a match, so what the client counts is the player's own record:
//! the hub bounds how fast each count may rise, nothing more. Adding an achievement is
//! one entry in [`ALL`] and the same id in the hub's catalogue.
