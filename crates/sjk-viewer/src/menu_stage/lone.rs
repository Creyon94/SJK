//! The Collection's Shaders tab shows the player's saber on its own (`docs/unlockables.md`,
//! "The Shaders tab"): the hilts the stage model would hold float before the backdrop
//! camera over the page's [`SABER_AREA`], lying across the window, turned as the page
//! says ([`SaberTurn`]), and the model is not drawn. Like the Holocrons tab's holocron
//! ([`crate::holocrons::stage`]), it is placed from the view the frame renders, so it
//! sits where the page leaves room in every window shape; it stands as far off as makes
//! the longest saber [`LENGTH`] frame pixels long, so a staff and a single saber fill the
//! same room.
//!
