//! The last leg of a join: once the gate stands fully open and the server
//! world is built, the camera leaves the browser vantage and glides through
//! the doorway into the map being joined. The world is adopted only after
//! the crossing, so the in-game cut happens with the destination already on
//! screen — and because it was built before the glide, nothing competes with
//! the render loop for the GPU on the way through, and the camera never
//! stands waiting beyond the doorway.
