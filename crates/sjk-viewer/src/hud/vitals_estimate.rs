//! Estimated health and shield (armour) of other players.
//!
//! The server sends a player's health and armour only to that player (and to
//! teammates through `tinfo`), but what it sends about everyone leaks most of
//! it. Each player is kept as a [`Range`] built from the server's own rules:
//!
//! - **Spawn** (`ClientSpawn`): a quarter over the maximum health and a quarter
//!   of it as armour, 125 and 25 in stock games, 100 and none in Duel. Learnt from
//!   the local player's own spawns when it has been seen, for mods that change it.
//! - **Decay** (`ClientTimerActions`): health and armour over the maximum lose a
//!   point a second.
//! - **Pain** (`P_DamageFeedback`): a hit of ten or more, at most every 700 ms,
//!   raises `EV_PAIN` on the player with the health left: exact.
//! - **Shield hits** (`EV_SHIELD_HIT`): how much armour a hit took, exactly.
//! - **Saber hits** (`EV_SABER_HIT`): the damage, in three sizes (under 5, under
//!   20, more). A missile that strikes a player (`EV_MISSILE_HIT`) is a hit of
//!   unknown size. With no pain after it, outside the 700 ms, a hit was under ten.
//! - **The local player's hits** (`PERS_ATTACKEE_ARMOR`): the health and armour
//!   of whoever it last hit, before the hit, matched to its victim.
//! - **Falls** (`EV_FALL`, `EV_ROLL`): the landing's damage, exactly.
//! - **Pickups** (`EV_ITEM_PICKUP`): medpacks and shields add their amount.
//! - **Force heal** (its sound at the player): 5, 10 or 25 by level.
//! - **Drain** heals the drainer by what it takes, an unknown amount.
//! - **Pain sounds** (`EV_ENTITY_SOUND` of `*pain25` to `*pain100`): where a server
//!   hides the pain value (JAPro's `g_stopHealthESP 2`) it plays the pain sound for
//!   the health left instead, which bounds it to a quarter.
//! - **Private duels** (`EV_PRIVATE_DUEL`): JA+ sets both duellists to 100 health
//!   and 100 armour when the duel starts and the winner to 100 and 25 when it ends;
//!   stock JKA leaves the start alone and heals the winner to the maximum. The start
//!   values are learnt from the local player's own duels when it has had one.
//! - **Chat protection** (JA+): a player with the chat balloon up (`EF_TALK`, for any
//!   reason) takes no damage unless they are in the middle of an action (a saber
//!   swing, a kick, a punch, a grab), so a hit seen on them without a pain or a shield
//!   flash takes nothing, nor does a fall. A pain or shield flash still counts.
//! - **Deaths** (`EF_DEAD`, `EV_OBITUARY`) and the respawn after one. A spawn
//!   with no death seen (a round or map restart) toggles `EF_TELEPORT_BIT`, as a
//!   teleport does, so that only raises the high bound to the spawn values.
//!
//! What is missed (lightning, hurt triggers, splash under ten, anything unseen
//! while a player is out of view) widens the range rather than moving the guess.
//!
//! Servers can hide the pain values: JAPro's `g_stopHealthESP` sends a fixed 50 or
//! no pain event at all. The local player's own pain events are checked against
//! its real health ([`PainReport`]); until one has been checked, pain values are
//! trusted but their absence proves nothing.
