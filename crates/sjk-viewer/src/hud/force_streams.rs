//! Force powers that act on other players shot by shot (drain, lightning and grip),
//! rebuilt from where everybody stands and looks, for the nameplates' estimates.
//!
//! Drain and lightning shoot every 50 ms while held (`WP_ForcePowerRun`'s
//! `FORCE_DEBOUNCE_TIME`; `ForceShootDrain`, `ForceShootLightning`, ported in
//! `sjk-game-jka`'s `force_dark.rs`). At level 3 a shot reaches every enemy whose box is
//! within reach of the caster's origin (512 units for drain, 300 for lightning), in
//! front of it (the middle of the box at most 60 degrees off the view) and in clear
//! sight; at levels 1 and 2 only the first player on a 2048-unit line along the view.
//!
//! - **Drain** takes 2, 3 or 4 Force from each victim by level, heals the drainer by as
//!   much (below its maximum) and holds back the victim's refill for 800 ms. It costs
//!   the drainer 5 a shot (at levels 1 and 2 only when the line found a player) and
//!   holds back its own refill for 500 ms.
//! - **Lightning** does 1 or 2 damage a shot, twice that two-handed (no weapon) at
//!   level 3; the armour takes it first. Its Force cost is the running cost
//!   ([`super::force_estimate`]). Each shot renews the victim's electrification to 800
//!   ms ahead when less than 400 ms is left, which every client is sent: a renewal
//!   proves a shot landed.
//! - An **absorb** that is up turns drain and lightning down by its level (what the
//!   levels' difference leaves) and gives the victim a point of Force a shot.
//! - **Grip** holds the first player on a 256-unit line from the gripper's eyes when
//!   it starts and does 2 damage past the armour then and every second after.
//!
//! Only `EV_FORCE_DRAINED`, at most every 400 ms a victim, names a drain victim, so the
//! shots are rebuilt with the world's walls in the way (not movers, nor other players
//! in the arc's line of sight). Other players' levels are not sent: the guess is level
//! 3's arc, a value's low bound takes the dearest level that reaches it and its high
//! bound the cheapest. The local player's own levels are its Force profile's.
