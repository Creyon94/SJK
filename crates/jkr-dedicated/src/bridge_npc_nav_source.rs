//! `g_npcNav`, this server's own option (not the reference's): navigation for NPCs on a
//! level that has none of its own. Server-side only, so stock clients see NPCs that hunt,
//! flank and take cover on maps that never shipped NPC navigation.
//!
//! - `0` (the default): the map's own `.nav` file or waypoints, exactly as the reference.
//! - `1`: the bots' route file (`botroutes/<map>.wnt`) made into the NPCs' graph.
//! - `2`: the route file, else a graph sampled from the map's collision.
//!
//! The rules are `jkr_game_jka::npc_nav_sources`; here the server reads the option and the
//! route file, sweeps its map (without movers, whose links the game flags) and seeds the
//! floor from the map's spawn points and items. It is read as a level begins: a change
//! takes effect with the next map or `map_restart`.
