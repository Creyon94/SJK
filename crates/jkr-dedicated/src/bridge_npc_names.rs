//! What this server lifts of the stock NPC and entity limits outside `g_stockRules 1`
//! (`bridge_stock_rules`), with the rules in `jkr_game_jka::npc_names`:
//!
//! - `npc spawn tauntaun` / `swoop` / any vehicle's name spawns the vehicle, where the
//!   reference wants `npc spawn vehicle <name>`;
//! - friendly names find their NPC or vehicle (`mine_monster` is `Minemonster`, `xwing`
//!   is `X-Wing`); a name several answer is refused with them;
//! - the NPC definitions are read however large, and an MD3 NPC (the mouse droid, the
//!   remote, the seeker, which MP refuses) spawns with its actual rigid model through stock-compatible presentation;
//! - the level's entities are not held to protocol 26's 1024 (what a legacy client cannot
//!   be sent is withheld from it and counted, `bridge_links`), nor its vehicle table to 16.
