//! jaPRO's movement styles, and which of them this client's movement prediction models.
//!
//! A jaPRO (TaystJK lineage) server lets each player pick a movement style (`/move`):
//! CPM, QW, Q3, WSW and others change friction, acceleration, air control and jumps
//! (JoF EternalJK `codemp/game/bg_pmove.c`, every `moveStyle` branch). The server says
//! which one in `ps.stats[STAT_MOVEMENTSTYLE]`, and a jaPRO-aware client reads it
//! (`PM_GetMovePhysics`, `bg_pmove.c:470-486`): `SWOOP` while riding a vehicle, the
//! co-op styles folded back onto their base style.
//!
//! SJK's pmove is stock JKA's, so predicting a style it does not model disagrees with
//! the server every frame and the view snaps back (hub reports #97/#98, 19/10/2026).
//! Until a style is ported it is shown as the server has it, as `cg_noPredict 1`
//! does; [`PREDICT_ANYWAY_CVAR`] predicts every style as JKA, the earlier behaviour.
//!
//! Porting a style: its physics go in this crate, beside the table (one module per
//! style family, CPM first: Q3, Slick and BotCPM build on it), called by the viewer's
//! prediction through the same bridge as [`unpredicted`]; once a recorded jaPRO demo
//! predicts it without misses, its entry turns `predicted: true`.
