//! (`:254-310`) → `CreateMissile` (`g_missile.c:297-325`); then `G_RunMissile`
//! (`:815-1030`) every server frame, until `G_MissileImpact` (`:362-810`) ends it on

//! The weapons so far: the pistol (`WP_FireBryarPistol` `:254-310`), the E11 blaster

//! `g_missile.c:154-210` and `EV_GRENADE_BOUNCE` — and the charged main fire fanning up
//! to five bolts of scaled damage at varied speeds) and the rocket launcher
//! (`WP_FireRocket` `:1909-1990`: a solid, damageable rocket of a hundred with a hundred
//! of splash over 160 units, the alternate at half the speed — its lock is not ported).
//! A missile that hits a player explodes on it as the reference has it
//! (`EV_MISSILE_HIT`, the player named) unless a saber blocks it
//! ([`crate::saber_block`]); the damage it does, direct and splash
//! ([`crate::damage::radius_damage`]), is the caller's.
