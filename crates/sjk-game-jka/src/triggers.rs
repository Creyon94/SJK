//! The triggers a map places (OpenJK `codemp/game/g_trigger.c` with `g_active.c`'s
//! `G_TouchTriggers`): brush entities that do something to whoever stands in them.
//!
//! Ported here are the hurt brushes — every pit, every lava floor and every crusher's
//! kill box is one. A hurt brush either takes health at its own rate (`dmg`, every
//! frame or, with the SLOW spawnflag, once a second) or, with `dmg -1`, begins the fall
//! to death that a bottomless pit is: the player screams, loses its controls, and dies
//! three seconds later wherever it has fallen to.
//!
//! A brush entity's shape comes from the map's inline model (`trap->SetBrushModel`),
//! which is the engine's; this module is given the bounds and asks the caller for the
//! exact contact, so the game crate keeps no map format of its own.
