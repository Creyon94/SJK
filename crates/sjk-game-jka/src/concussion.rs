//! The concussion rifle's alternate fire (OpenJK `codemp/game/g_weapon.c:3080-3339`): a
//! rail-like beam of up to three traces through whatever it strikes, twenty-five to a
//! player without knockback or hit location, then the shove and the knockdown of
//! `knockdown::concussion_shove`; the shooter shoved backwards for a quarter second; one
//! temp entity for the whole beam.
