//! A lit saber against missiles, as the reference's game module has it:
//!
//! - `WP_SaberStartMissileBlockCheck` (OpenJK `codemp/game/w_saber.c:5456-5846`), run for
//!   every playing client each server frame before the missiles move: the look target
//!   (`ClientBegin`'s `hasLookTarget`, whatever the weapon), and — with a saber in hand,
//!   idle — the nearest missile within 256 units coming at the player, which raises the
//!   saber towards it a frame early (`saberBlocked`, the quadrant of
//!   `WP_SaberBlockNonRandom` `:9133-9205`).
//! - `G_MissileImpact`'s block (`g_missile.c:498-563`) when a missile strikes the player:
//!   `WP_SaberCanBlock` (`w_saber.c:9282-9455`: the saber's state, the attack button,
//!   `InFront` `NPC_senses.c:103-119` with the defense level's cone), the `EV_SABER_BLOCK`
//!   flash, the defense counted one level lower while jumping or backpedalling, then the
//!   bolt reflected back at its shooter (level 3, `G_ReflectMissile` `:43-101`), deflected
//!   away (level 2, `G_DeflectMissile` `:103-150`) or killed on the blade (level 1), and
//!   `saberBlockTime` (nothing for level 3, 150 ms for 2, 250 ms for 1).
//! - The bounce's jitter is the C library's `rand()` through `RandFloat` (`w_saber.c:56-67`),
//!   ported in [`crate::crt_rand`]. On the reference's Linux build the fix `g_randFix` names
//!   is compiled out (`__GCC__` is no compiler's macro), so `rand()`'s 31 bits are divided
//!   by 32768: the jitter dwarfs the direction and a bounced bolt climbs into the octant
//!   of the three draws. The port follows the build the owner plays against.
//!
//! Held against `tools/game-oracle/saberblock.c`. What is not ported: the held saber's
//! own box (`CONTENTS_LIGHTSABER`, positioned from the model's bolts — JKR's server has no
//! skeleton yet), which the reference deflects from without a block check; NPCs; thrown
//! sabers; the shield of a siege class.
