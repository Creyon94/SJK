//! only the sounds past the cap are dropped. Stock cgame has no such cap.

//! It covers the server's toggle (`G_Sound` of a hilt's `soundOn`/`soundOff`, taken as
//! the nearest player's like [`super::saber_overrides`] does), `EV_SABER_UNHOLSTER` and
//! cgame's own switch sounds ([`super::saber_switch`]).
