//! `g_stockRules`: this server's own option (not the reference's). JKR's server lifts
//! the limits and quirks a stock server has — `0`, the default — and keeps the stock
//! behaviour exactly with `1`, for operators who want a server indistinguishable from a
//! stock one. Each place that differs says so where it reads [`NativeGame::stock_rules`]:
//! a passed team vote makes its leader (`bridge_team_votes`); `npc spawn` of a vehicle's
//! name spawns the vehicle, friendly names find their NPC, MD3 NPCs spawn with a Ghoul2
//! stand-in, and the entity budget, NPC files and vehicle table are not capped
//! (`bridge_npc_names`); native sand-creature AI runs outside stock mode
//! (`bridge_npcs`, `sjk_game_jka::npc_sand_creature`).
